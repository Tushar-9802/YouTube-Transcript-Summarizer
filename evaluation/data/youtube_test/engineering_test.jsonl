What does it mean and why do we need to worry about it? Yeah, what does it mean to say it's a language? It's usually in this context, a programming language is or is not Turing complete. Well, obvious first example is that every programming language you're familiar with. I mean we'll refer to the usual suspects, Fortran, basic Pascal, cobalt C, C++, Java, they are all Turing complete. So what fundamentally does a thing have to be in order to be Turing complete? And the answer is it needs to be able to do everything that a Turing machine can do. Mostfully we have made several videos on this topic, some for me, some for my colleague Mark Jago and we have visited quite a lot of these issues just to recap. A Turing machine is thought of as an endless infinite piece of tape and it has a read-write head that goes over the top of the marks on that tape which can be anything you like but conventionally to keep it very simple you say it's zeros and ones and you can show that just the ability to read and write on an infinite piece of tape patterns of zeros and ones is powerful enough to compute anything that can be computed. Admittedly your low-level Turing program with all its zeros and ones may be 10 trillion times longer than your comparcy program I don't know but in principle it can do exactly the same. Some people argue that actually although it was Turing that made brought this all to our attention in the late 30s with the work he did, in some ways some people would say it really ought to be called Babbage Complete because another UK, well he was a computer scientist actually in the way his brain worked. Jaws Babbage, many of you know he started off by just doing very powerful calculating machines, different engines. Well going beyond that some of you will know that Charles Barrage said well that's just like a calculator that you have in your top pocket but where's about 10 tons and full of cog wheels but even just using cog wheels he went on and said I want to do something that really can compute in the way that a human can do and the one thing he realized straight away is to make it really powerful enough you must at very minimum have what was called in those days conditional branching if statements. You've got to be able to say that I'm going to look at a certain cell on my tape and if it's got a 1 in it I'm going to do this thing and if you're going to zero in it I'm going to do that thing. So it's this sort of two-way choice that if then else statement can give you. And he said it's absolutely vital to be able to do that because very often the computations that humans do depend on the precise nature of the data they are given. Some data will send you one way, some data will send you another. So this conditional branching is absolutely vital and as a sort of kind of result or side effect of that, it's also implicitly means that you've got to have the ability to go to somewhere different in your memory. For example you might be saying if this condition is true then I carry on with the sequence of instructions that immediately follow. But on the other hand if the L statement is true then I have to go off somewhere else and do something different. Now all our undergraduates we absolutely do not encourage the raw use of go-to's because it's not good well-structured programming but those who have done assembler will know that under the hood you can't avoid it. You really do have go-to statements which say I'm here at location 88 or whatever now jump off to location 200. So if you like the conditional branching implies a go-to in that you might stay in this part of the tape, you might jump off somewhere else. We've seen on the Turing machine videos it's perfectly possible to get your read-write head chattering across the tape until it finds a pattern that it likes the look of. The other thing for Turing completeness is you must be able to have arbitrary amount of memory. At the very basic level you must be able to have a long enough tape in either direction and on modern machines what that means is the totality of the RAM that you possess you must be able to get as much memory as the problem needs. So that's the fundamental thing then as much memory as you need and conditional branching and the bedrock that is what you absolutely must have. If a Turing machine has in principle unlimited memory, none of our computers are arbitrary machines then. Sure, I'm so glad you asked that question and I didn't prompt you. I didn't prime you in any way. But yes, you can say that absolutely none of our so-called infinitely powerful Turing machines can be because they've all got finite memory. And if you go back to the Chomsky hierarchy, you will find if you can have arbitrary amounts of memory and if things might go on forever and you never know whether they're going to terminate or not in the general case then you're in Chomsky type 0. The moment you say ah but it's got to terminate within a finite amount of memory you're down in Chomsky type 1. So you can say yes essentially, finiteness of memory enforces that restriction on you anyway. Down to type 1 instead of type 0. First of all what does a Turing machine actually look like? What does it do? So So here we are then, this is true. We ask it a question and it will give us an answer, yes or no.", "transcript_length": 1020, "reference_summary": "Turing completeness is a fundamental concept in computer science that indicates a programming language's capability to perform any computation that a Turing machine can execute. A Turing machine, conceptualized by Alan Turing in the 1930s, consists of an infinite tape and a read-write head that manipulates symbols (typically represented as zeros and ones) on that tape. For a programming language to be Turing complete, it must possess certain features, primarily the ability to implement conditional branching\u2014essentially \"if-then-else\" statements. This allows the program to make decisions based on the data it processes, enabling it to follow different execution paths.\n\nWhile many well-known programming languages, such as C, Java, and Python, are Turing complete, the concept also highlights the theoretical limits of computation. It emphasizes that, despite differences in syntax and efficiency, all Turing complete languages can compute the same set of problems, albeit potentially with varying resource requirements. Additionally, some argue that Charles Babbage's early work on computing machines should also be recognized in discussions of Turing completeness, as his ideas laid the groundwork for conditional logic in computation. Ultimately, understanding Turing completeness is crucial for grasping the capabilities and limitations of programming languages in the realm of computation.", "channel": "Computerphile"}

describing its history and the methods the character of its discovery and its quality talking about modern science completely modern. This law has been called the greatest generalization achieved by the human mind and you can get already from the by introduction I'm more interested not so much in the human mind as in the marvel of nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nda reaktsa, changes velocity more if the mass is lower and so on, inversely as the mass. Then I have said everything about the law of gravitation that needs to be said. Everything else is a consequence, a mathematical consequence of those two things that I said. That's a remarkable enough phenomenon in itself that the next lecture will consider this in more detail.

These two tacks are the foci and if the sun is here, the shape of the orbit of a planet around the sun is one of these curves. The next question is, and going around the ellipse, how does it go? Does it go faster when it's near the sun, slower when it's further from the sun, and so on. We take away the other focus, we have the sun then and the planet going around. nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nd the area that's enclosed in the orbit of the planet and the two lines that are separated by the planet's position three weeks apart is the same no matter what part of the orbit the thing is on. So that it has to go faster when it's closer in order to get the same area as it goes slower when it's further away and in this precise manner. nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'aibhe d'a of the planets around the sun. The next question was, what makes him go around? Well, how can we understand this in more detail? Or is there anything else to say? In the meantime, Galileo was investigating the laws of motion. Incidentally, at the time of Kepler, the problem of what drove the planets around the sun was answered in certain, by some people, by saying that there were angels behind here beating their wings and pushing the planet along around orbit. As we'll see that that answer is not very far from the truth, the only difference is that the angels sit in a different direction and were wings going up. But the point that the angels sit in a different direction is the one that I must now come to. Galaleo, in studying the laws of motion and doing a number of experiments to see how balls roll down inclined planes and pendulous swung and so on, discovered a idealization, a great principle called a principle of inertia, which is this, that if a thing has nothing acting on it, if an object has nothing acting on it and is going along in a certain velocity in a straight line, it will go at the same velocity at exactly the same straight line forever. nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  an impulling force and this is proportional to the mass so that if we would take two different obvious first swing one and then swing another one at the same speed around the head and measured the force in the second one that second one the new force is bigger than the other force in the proportion that the masses are different this is a way of measuring the masses by how much how hard it is to change the speed now then newton saar, a fom this. A four instance to take a simple example, if a planet is going in a circle around the sun, no force is needed to make it go sideways tangentially. If there were no force at all on it, it would have just keep coasting this way. But actually the planet doesn't keep coasting this way, but finds itself later not out here where it would go if there were no force at all. nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd nd  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  600, dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe dwe d nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  was that it was the earth that was pulled by the moon away from the water. So actually Newton was the first one to realize what actually was going on. That the force of the moon on the earth and on the water is the same at the same distance.

Another opportunity for Newton's laws to be found wanting, but courage. Two men, both who made these calculations, Adams and Laveriaire independently and in almost exactly the same time, proposed that the motions of Uranus were due to an unseen as yet new planet.

So the Earth's gravitational field never ends but peters out very slowly in a precise and careful law probably to the edges of the universe. The law of gravitation is different than many of the other wellers is very important in the economy or in the machinery of the universe. There are many places where gravity has its practical applications as far as the universe is concerned. But atypically, among all the other laws of physics, gravitation has relatively few practical applications. I mean the new knowledge of the law, it has a lot of applications, it keeps people in their seats. But it has few, the knowledge of the law has few practical applications relatively speaking compared to the other laws. nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda

I ask talk about the things that are common to the various laws because we don't know which don't understand the connection between them but what's very strange is that there are certain things that are the same in both. But now let's look again at the law of electricity. The law goes in verse is the square of the distance. But the thing that is remarkable is the tremendous difference in the strength of the electrical and gravitational laws. People who want to make electricity and nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  ndo wou d'inches o yeers o anythin o do o our own dimension, wou can do it this way. If we take the fundamental particles such as an electron, any different ones will give different numbers, but to get an idea of the number, take electrons. Two electrons are fundamental particles, that's an object that's not something I can't... I don't have to tell you what units I measure in, it's two particles that are fundamental particles. They repel each other, the inverses are square, the distance to the electricity, and they attract each other, the inverses are square, the distance to the gravitation. qeishti, wak dhe raseo dhe gravatational force to the electrical force? And that is illustrated on the next slide. The ratio of the gravitational attraction to the electrical repulsion is given by a number with 42 digits. And goes off here, it's all this is written very carefully out, so that's 42 digits. Now therein lies a very deep mystery. Where could such a tremendous number come from? nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda nda  the diameter of a proton. Amazingly enough it also is a number with 42 digits. And so an interesting proposal is made that this ratio is the same as the ratio of the size of the universe to the diameter of a proton. But the universe is expanding with time and that would mean the gravitational constant is changing with time.

Feynman, a renowned theoretical physicist from the California Institute of Technology, significantly contributed to the field of physics, particularly during the post-war era. His ability to clarify complex concepts and bring order to the rapid advancements in physics earned him widespread recognition, including the prestigious Albert Einstein Award in 1954. Feynman's work emphasized the importance of understanding the underlying rhythms and patterns of nature, which he referred to as physical laws. He believed that while aesthetic pleasure could be derived from observing natural phenomena, true comprehension comes from analytical exploration. Feynman's legacy continues to inspire future generations of scientists and thinkers, highlighting the interplay between observation and analysis in the pursuit of knowledge. His contributions not only advanced theoretical physics but also fostered a deeper appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the universe.", "channel": "Tinkerin' Thinkers"}

So the course is going to be taught on Canvas. So the Canvas site has been published. We will for homeworks and things like that, they'll be handed out and turned in on paper, but you can download them from Canvas as well. The classes are going to be here Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, so unusual class schedules 1 p.m. I've mentioned the textbook. There are some other textbooks that you might find handy and I've listed those in the course handout. are completely optional, you don't have to buy them, the libraries also have copies. The way homeworks will work in this class is that will typically be issued on a Monday and do the following Monday, okay? And for the most part, you are allowed to collaborate and talk about the homework problems, so feel free to get together and discuss the problems that it's intended that you do so. The only constraint we have is that you must hand in your own solution, right? So you can trade ideas, but in the end, the thing you write up, it can't be a copy of your neighbors. It has to be your solution, but you can base it on, you know, ideas you've exchanged with others, okay? For those who don't know anybody or don't have access to study partners and may have questions, first of all, there will be office hours. Moncie's office hours will be Thursdays 4 to 5 p.m. and Fridays 4 to 5 p.m. in 10178 and building 10. Okay, but there are also a number of students in the Lee's Laboratory 10.050 who have had this class before and will be happy to answer any questions. And a few of those students are listed in the course description. We've also decided not to have exams this term or in-class exams, rather we're going to have assessments, which are essentially take-home mini quizzes. They will generally be, they'll be generally issued weekly. And this says they're going to be issued starting on March 1st. I should check if they, starting on March 1st, they'll be issued weekly. They'll be issued on a Wednesday. They will be due the next day Thursday. And those will be submitted through Canvas, through Gradescope. As for homeworks, we can take late homeworks if you arrange it ahead of time and there's some compelling reason why they're late. Assessments are a different story. Also, the collaboration policy for assessments is different. You cannot collaborate or discuss the problems at all for assessments and we can't prove or not prove that you're doing so. but this is an exam effectively. So don't discuss it with your neighbors and don't discuss anything until the solutions are out because there may be people who have made some special arrangement because they're traveling or for whatever reason to hand it in late. So we're gonna have homeworks and assessments and the goal of the assessments really is instead of a sort of very few high stakes opportunities to show your abilities, the assessments are sort of distributed in low stakes and focused and gives you a better opportunity to show you what you really know. Okay? So please complete them entirely on your own. No consultation. The only thing you're allowed to do is ask the course staff clarifying questions just the way you might in an exam. And as for the assessments, you can use any of the course materials, you know, read the book, whatever you want. Do not go outside and try to use the World Wide Web. And for that matter, the use of Bibles is also prohibited. I know that there's collections of old 6334 materials floating around. You're not supposed to be consulting those. This is just supposed to be a measure of what you've learned. So the grading will be based on three components. Homeworks are going to be 40%. These assessments will be 50%. And there's also a final project, which is 10%. And the final project sounds like it's only 10%, but it's the last thing we look at when we're going to assign a grade to everybody. And it really is your opportunity to put together knowledge that you've learned throughout the class into a real, it's on paper, it's not a physical converter you will construct, but it's a paper design. But it's really your opportunity to show us how you've synthesized all this knowledge to be able to really design power electronics. And I should say, just as an aside, in this class, we only have a paper design, or, but this complements nicely the undergraduate power electronics class, which has a lot of really nice lab activities and design activities there. So even if you're a graduate student, it can be a pretty good thing to take in terms of rounding out your lab skill set in this area. Okay. If you have any necessary technical accommodations, don't have access to iPads or whatever else you need for Gradescope, please let us know. We'll try to assist with that. So with that, are there any questions about anything like associated with the course mechanics? OK. So let me give you a sense of what this course is going to be about. And this is one of my favorite photos. It's actually one that Nikola Tesla mocked up. He wasn't really sitting next to his Tesla coil when he did this, or he might have gotten killed. He kind of double exposed this. But more to the point, the quote from him is, if we could produce electrical effects of the required quality, this whole planet and the conditions of existence on it could be transformed. And I think the sort of the more than a hundred years since he said that, or well more than a hundred years since he said that, have borne that out. But it's also true that even today there's really revolutions happening in the way we use energy. Everything's being electrified from vehicles to transportation to power generation from renewable resources and handling all that requires some means of processing, controlling, converting energy. And that's really what we're about, processing, controlling, converting electrical energy. If you look at what the IEEE, which is sort of the governing body of electrical engineering, says about power electronics, it says this technology encompasses the use of of electronic components, the application of circuit theory and design techniques, and the development of analytical tools towards efficient electronic conversion control and conditioning of electric power. And that's what we're really about here. So we're going to do circuit theory. We're going to learn design techniques. We're going to learn about all the components you need to do this. We're going to learn about controls. How do you put it all together to make energy conversion systems? So as I mentioned, the primary function of power electronics is to take sort of electrical energy in one form and convert it into some other form you need. It's really a core technology in the electrical infrastructure. It used to be that the AC grid was generators, and you'd connect it up to things like, directly things like motors or lighting or whatever. But that's pretty much changed at this point, right? Lighting is LED lighting. You need power supplies to go between the grid and the lighting. Same thing, heavily loads computers, motors, everything else you need, energy tends to flow through one or even several layers of power conversion circuitry from the principal source to the final usage. And so the power electronics, first of all, the efficiency of that is very important, but also how you do it impacts the quality of the final system. So the power electronics can really be a major factor impacting what you can and can't do and how well it works. So if you'd showed up 100 years ago, this is what power electronics would look like, some vacuum tubes and some transformers and that kind of thing. Interestingly, of course, it's nothing like that today. But with the techniques you're going to learn in this course, you could actually go back and analyze this thing and figure out what it did. So some foundational ideas that we're going to come back to, which can be 100 years old, but there's also elements that are extremely new. Okay? And today, this was fancy 100 years ago. Today, power electronics is everywhere. From, I say from milliwatts to gigawatts, and it does actually use switch mode power conversion down to those power levels. This is actually a multi-watt power supply. And this is literally at the gigawatt scale. So if you go out to the Sandy Pond terminal, There is a power converter that takes two gigawatts coming down from Canada hydro and converts it to AC to power homes and everything else around here, right? So, and the techniques that we're going to learn in this class really span the entire range, right? So some of the details change and we'll learn about that, but there's underlying principles that cut across all kinds of electrical energy conversion systems, okay? What kind of applications? Well, portable electronics. It's slightly older, and iPhone 5, and you think, okay, iPhone's got radio transmitters and displays and other stuff in it. But it turns out that a large fraction of the volume and board area is actually associated with energy conversion in the thing. Because no matter what you're doing, you're processing energy to process information, right? So something like 40% of the motherboard in this example was associated with power conversion. Likewise, at some point you're going to charge your phone or your iPad or your computer into the wall, that's mostly power electronics too. All kinds of computers, if you're in a data center, there's several layers of power conversion between the AC grid and the final set of processors. This is more of what it looks like inside your home computer. We'll actually learn exactly about those kind of converters and about all the components that are in them. If you're gonna communicate, the transmitters, We tend to think of this as analog circuits to make RF transmitters, but in fact, power electronics are heavily embedded in any real communication systems to increase the efficiency of transmission. All kinds of commercial applications, whether you're doing LED lighting or this is actually from some water purity device, but of course it requires a power supply, right? So almost any use of energy these days requires a power supply. Even in your home, I mentioned that it used to be that you'd connect motors up to the grid and they'd run and maybe you'd turn them on and off, something like that. But no longer, right? If you want high performance, you need to be able to modulate that energy. So two examples here. This is for an air conditioning unit. And it uses an inverter, a DC to AC converter inside it to drive the motor much more quietly and much more modulated for higher overall system efficiency. Even your dishwasher these days has power converters in it because it's more efficient, in this case, quieter to do it that way. Ideas that you might not think of as power converters, medical applications. This is actually a magnetic stimulator, generates 5,000 amps pulse trains in a transducer coil to throw out magnetic fields that can trigger nerves. This is an interesting one. It's actually homework zero. So the thing you're analyzing in the first homework, just to break the rust off, is actually this box right here. Scientific applications. You may not be processing energy, but even if you just need to generate high electrical fields for whatever reason, or magnetic fields, as in the magnetic stimulator, you need energy conversion circuits to do it. Then there's the more maybe the applications you might think of, transportation. I'd say the electric vehicle or hybrid vehicle, you need power electronics to drive the energy conversion. This is not a small thing. First of all, you need the power electronics to drive these things. Secondly, in fact, in one example, they redesigned the power converter for a Prius, the power train for the Prius, the fuel economy went up by 5%, just by redesigning the power electronics to be better. So it has a huge impact on the overall application. And of course, that's electric vehicles, but traction, right, trains, that's higher power, but the same issue. Actually, even future trains, it's a little hard to see behind this railing, that's a maglev, magnetically levitated train. Along the wayside, over in the back corner, you see this big building here inside that big building as these racks of power electronics. Now, you better have pretty reliable power electronics if your vehicle is flying along at 400 kilometers an hour floating on that far off the ground. So not only do you need efficiency, but you need reliability and precision. Even stranger things. This is an example of a drone just powered by high voltage. You just apply high voltage. It breaks down the air, accelerates ions. And you can use that for propulsion. That's the first demonstration of it. But it actually is very similar in some regards to what people use for space propulsion. You've heard of ion engines, the twin ion engine, TIE fighter, or what more practically they use to reposition satellites. Those require power electronics to generate high voltages and accelerate ions. power transmission and generation. So you're getting your energy from somewhere, and increasingly we're getting it from renewable resources. Well, generally, the way things are trending, you take some mechanical or solar or other source of energy and you transition it not only through a generator, but through power electronics to get there. And that's true for terrestrial things, things like, this is a house rooftop PV system. This is a microinverter. Automotive systems are even much smaller. Things like power harvesting, energy harvesting techniques, you need power electronics in it. Also, all kinds of industrial applications, whether you're doing plasma processing for semiconductor processing or you want to refine metals like a DC arc furnace, you need power electronics there too. So it's just sort of a long way of saying power electronics are in almost everything you care about these days. And it's only getting worse though, because we have to be better about how we use energy. So what's inside a power converter? And we're going to talk about this in much greater detail. But if you want to think about it, What we have is typically some kind of energy storage elements. These could be inductors or capacitors or sometimes other things. And what we're going to do is we're going to use semiconductor switches, and we're going to draw energy from some source. We're going to manipulate it somehow, so we store it in these energy storage elements, and then we're going to put it to the output. And we're going to repeat that. So draw, transform, put it to the output. Because we do this on a cyclic basis, we generate sort of ripple and potentially noise that could interfere with things like television or electronics. So you generally need filters to do that too. We also, of course, need to control that flow of energy. We can't be stupid about it. We have to, especially for something high performance, like a microprocessor, which might be changing its operation very, very fast, we need to control that flow. So there's control circuitry. We're going to be learning about all of the aspects of designing all of these kinds of elements. So we're leveraging everything from circuit design, semiconductor devices, passive components and materials, increasingly packaging and cooling and controls also matter. And things have been getting better and better and better, both because the ways we can manufacture things get better, and because the devices, which we have our access to in order to implement these things get better. Okay, and so we're gonna look at some of the different ways you can do that. I'll just give you one example. This is what you would find something like in a data center, right? So they come in, they rectify the voltage, they get it sort of 400 volts for reasons we'll go into. This converter here was designed to take that 400 volts and bring it down to 12 volts. That tiny little thing a little bit bigger than a penny there actually can handle a kilowatt. Then you need more converters to take it down from there to the one volt that the processor uses. So a long way of saying all kinds of things are limited by energy and how we can control it across all these applications. And what we're usually trying to do is figure out how to make them smaller and lighter. If you're sticking up 40% of your iPhone, you wanna make that thing smaller so it doesn't take that up and you can replace that volume either with nothing or with things that are more interesting to you. We need higher efficiency, both for the converters in the systems. How we process energy can matter to the not only the ultimate efficiency of the converter, but the efficiency of the system, how it uses energy, can be determined by the power electronics. We want higher performance, that could mean higher bandwidth or other aspects. And then there's all kinds of means that we can use better electrical processing to enable new applications. So these are the kind of things that we're gonna learn about this term. I'll pause there, I've been going on a while, are there any questions about any of this before we get going? This is just to sort of orient you to what we're going to focus the term on. I can put the slides on Canvas, sure. Any other questions? Okay. I will just give you a slight notion. Okay. This is a favorite thing I'd like to bring in just to show you the kind of things we're going to look at this term. This is a piece of commercial hardware from a company called MKS Instruments that I just happen to have in my office. This input piece is a filter, so you don't create electromagnetic interference and you don't generate noise you don't want. Then this piece here takes energy from the 60 hertz grid and generates DC from it, and And it has to do it while making the whole thing look like a resistor to the grid so you don't mess up the grid. Okay, that's what this part does. Then it has these isolated DC to DC converters that can take that DC voltage and generate other DC voltages referenced in other ways and without worrying about sort of currents going back to ground. Okay, it's galvanically isolated. And then it takes that energy and goes back DC to AC. Okay. systems you might go DC to AC for 60 hertz to generate into the grid or for a motor or something else. This particular one has these outputs that are at 13 megahertz for driving plasmas to process semiconductors. But you get all these kinds of functions, AC to DC, DC to DC, DC to AC. And we're going to learn, first of all, the underlying principles of doing all these things and how to design them. So the real goal is, by the time you walk out of here, you should have all the tools to go off and design power electronics for all kinds of applications. And in fact, graduates of this class have worked on electric vehicles, battery chargers, solar, communication systems, data centers, in fact, the power supply usually use for my laptop and the, in fact, the wireless charger for my eye watch were all designed, or the teams were led by graduates of this class, right? So this, the goal is to give you the tools you need to go do these things, okay? So with that, let me start by just giving you a sense of what goes on inside power electronics. So let's think of the simplest case. I have some DC input voltage, and I'd like some other DC voltage. So suppose I have some input that's, you know, maybe it's 9 volts to 16 volts. I'm making that up arbitrarily, but that's roughly what you might get in a typical vehicle out of the cigarette lighter. And I'll call this V in. And suppose I want here's some load that I'm going to represent with a resistor. I'm going to call that V out. And suppose I want EG 5 volts to power something that takes 5 volts. What's the most obvious and simple way to get 5 volts at my output from some higher voltage? Voltage divider, precisely. I could come up here. I could say, OK, let me put in some variable resistor. And I'll drop down this voltage to give me the voltage I want. And I'm done. And in fact, a lot of systems, that's exactly more or less what they have inside them. In fact, inside most integrated circuits, there's lots of these things going on. Well, OK, they don't do it quite this way. What do they really do? They will take Vn. And what they will do is they'll use some kind of transistor, a MOSFET or a bipolar transistor. And they will treat that essentially as a variable resistor. So I implement the variable resistor with a controlled transistor. And I will come. And I'll have some feedback loop. I'll feed in a reference voltage. And I'll measure the output voltage. And I'll control the gate of this transistor and essentially make that transistor look like a variable resistor and control the voltage division so that even if this voltage varies between 9 and 16 volts, I always get my 5 volts output. And like I said, that's very common. But what's the problem with this? Well, there's a whole lot of problems with this. Why wouldn't you want to do this in typical operation? Terrible efficiency. Terrible efficiency, yes, exactly. So let's think about this. If I accept the fact, let me call this current i in. And this current i out. If this thing does act exactly like a variable resistor, the input currents equal the output current. Now, this actually a real system might have some current that actually also goes to ground. Well, let's take the best case where the output currents equal to the input current. What would be the efficiency of this beast? Well, the efficiency is equal to the output power over the input power. I'm drawing energy maybe from my car battery or whatever my battery source is, and I'm delivering it to the output. But not all of it's getting to the output. So the output power is v out times i out. And my input power is v in times i in. And I just told you that i out was equal to i in in the best case. So that's v out over v in. So if I'm coming in from 15 volts and I'm getting 5 volts, that's 33% efficiency. I've taken two thirds of my energy and thrown it away. Now, if I got lots of energy floating around and I'm processing a microwatt, maybe I don't care. Maybe I'll live with that because this thing's pretty simple, right? It's a transistor. It's a power transistor and some controls. And they can often put all that on one integrated circuit or even as a subblock on an integrated circuit. I might still need some filtering. It's not quite as easy as it sounds. But pretty much, it's relatively simple, but my efficiency is miserable. Now, if I thought about it in your computer, your desktop computer, typically the intermediate supply that you're getting after it's coming from the grid and then transformed down, you get 12 volts. And let's say your computer is it depends on what it's doing, let's say it's operating at a volt. And then you're less than 10% efficient. And if you think that you can have a microprocessor that's taking 200 amps at a volt, so a few hundred watts, suddenly, if I've got less than 10% efficiency on 200 watts, that means I need to put in a few kilowatts. Well, you can't even plug that into the wall. And never mind the fact that you've just made a massive room heater. That's like, that'd be great for heating your dorm room, but pretty terrible for the overall system. So the number one reason we don't like this solution is efficiency. Good thing is simple. Bad thing is terrible efficiency. This technique I should have noted is what's known for historical reasons as a quote unquote linear power supply. Why linear? I think only because analog circuits, kind of a category of them, became known as, quote unquote, linear circuits. There's nothing really that linear about it. But this would be called a linear power converter. Or sometimes a linear regulator is what it would be called. For obvious reasons, I hate throwing away energy. We're not going to talk about linear regulators at all in this class. And there's plenty of classes where you can learn about that. We want to do things some better way that's not going to burn lots of energy. So ideally, in my world, the goal is to take as much of the input energy in and put it to the output. And that's important because think about it this way. I showed you a photograph of something that was really tiny, maybe that big, and that thick, and was processing a kilowatt. If I don't do that at really high efficiency, that thing will burn up. So in order to make something small, I need to make it efficient. So we want almost all of the energy at the input to get to the output. Well, how can we do that? Let's think of a completely different way we might achieve this same function. And here's the idea. Here's my input. I'm going to create a switch here, a single pole double throw switch. Now, we're not going to get physical switches. We're probably going to get semiconductor devices and make it do something like this. But we could use any technology that was practical as a switch. And let me just define. I'm going to define a switching function that I want to call Q of t. If Q of t is 1, I'll connect the switch to the input. If Q of t is 0, I'll connect the switch to the ground. So this notion, this voltage, maybe I'll call this voltage vx. So one thing I could do is I could say, OK, Let me just hook this up to my resistive load, whatever it is, and I'll call this v out. Well, all right, what would that look like? Well, let me define my switching function. I'm going to put the switch in the up position for a little while. And then I'll put it in the down position by setting the switching function to 0. And then I'll just repeat that. So I said we're going to operate in some kind of repetitive fashion here and so forth. Let me operate with some period t. That's coming in my switching period. In this example, I'm showing you the fixed switching period. And I will keep the switch in the up position some fraction of the time that I'll call dt. So d is a fraction. 0 is less than d is less than 1. So if I do that, then what do I get for vx? vx is going to look something like this. When the switch is in the up position, vx equals v in. So this is vx. When the switch is in the down position, Vx is equal to 0. And I rinse and repeat, and I get this. Now I have this pulsating voltage Vx. What's the average value of that voltage Vx? I can take simple integration, 1 over t, the integral of Vx of t over a period t. And what I would find is the average voltage of Vx is equal to d times Vn. So I can create a waveform here whose average value is something different than Vn just by controlling this timing, d. So now, if my load resistor here was a space heater, maybe this is some load resistance RL, and I wanted to modulate the power to that load resistance by controlling the average voltage on the load resistance, then this technique would work great. If, on the other hand, my load was a microprocessor and I start pulsing between 12 volts and 0 and I'm probably going to blow it up, right? So it's no good. But this notion is at least that I can control an average voltage by pulsing a switch. And this would be known as PWM or pulse width modulation because I control the average voltage by the fraction of the time the switch is in one position versus the other. So that's the basic concept we're going to be using. How do I fix this little problem of impractice? What I wanted was a DC voltage. What I got was a pulsating voltage that just happened to have the right average value. Well, I could go do something like this. Maybe I'll go back and say, OK, let me throw in a filter and extract out the component I want. I want the average value of Vx. So maybe I'll come back here and say, OK, Let me throw in a filter. And I'll use an inductor here, an L. And if I want optionally, I can put a capacitor here, C. And I think people can look at this filter block and recognize that as a low pass filter. The DC component of Vx passes through the filter to the output. And the AC component of Vx gets rejected by the filter and doesn't get to the output. So in this case, I might get an output voltage V out that looks something like this. I'm going to sort of make this up, but I'm amplifying the ripple. But eventually, it's going to filter the energy content of that and the fundamental and higher harmonic terms The Vx are going to go away, and the DC term is going to go through. And I get an output voltage V out that's very close to whatever value I want. And if I basically make the filter cut off hard enough, I can't distinguish between V out and the average value of Vx, and I get exactly what I wanted. So we've essentially now created a voltage converter that lets me use this pulse width modulation by controlling this duty cycle D to regulate the output just the way I wanted. So instead of here, I'm just changing the gate voltage on my transistor to control the output. Here, I'm changing timing. I'm going to control timing. And by controlling timing, I control average value, and then I get what I want. Any questions about that? What's the efficiency of the supply? That is an excellent question. The answer is, ideally, theoretically, the efficiency can be 100%. In reality, it can't be. Why do I say the efficiency can ideally be 100%? Well, how would I implement this box in the real world? Usually, I don't get semiconductor single pole double throw switches. The way I would usually build this beast is like this. I would usually have a first switch and a second switch implemented like this. So I close this when q of t is equal to 1. And I close this 1, 1q of t is equal to 0. And then I build my filter. And then I put my load on here. So what would be the efficiency of this thing? Well, let's think about this. This is voltage v sub x, and this is voltage v sub out. What power is theoretically dissipated in my switch? If I have an ideal switch, has zero resistance when it's on, and has infinite resistance when it's off? No power? What's that? Zero power. Why? Because the power dissipated, the power that goes into this box, let me call this V switch, and we call this I switch. OK? Well, p-switch, the power going into the switch, the power being dissipated in the switch, is going to be v-switch times i-switch. Well, if it's an ideal switch, then if the switch is on, v-switch is 0. It's ideal, so it has no voltage drop when it's on. So the power when it's on is 0. When the switch is off, it has infinite resistance, So the switch is current zero. So basically, the power going into the switch, if it's an ideal switch, is ideally zero. So these elements, this ideal switch, is a lossless element. Likewise, I didn't just randomly choose any filter here. I chose an LC filter. Why did I choose an LC filter? I chosen LC filter because inductors and capacitors are energy storage elements. If they're ideal, then they store energy, but they don't dissipate energy. So basically, everything in the white box here, everything between the input and the output, is a lossless element. So then one would assume that if every element's lossless, any energy walking in to the left comes out to the right. And that's how that kilowatt little 400 volt to 12 volt converter I showed you. And the photo is about 97% efficient. It's not 100% because the wires have some resistance and the switches have some on-state resistance. There's a whole bunch of things that contribute to loss, and we'll talk about that. But I can make it really close to 100%, even though I might be doing a huge step down. So if I tried to build a linear regulator that is going from 400 to 12 volts, that'd be about 2 and 1 half percent efficient. So if I want to generate a kilowatt at 2 and 1 half percent efficiency, what is that 40 kilowatt input? And instead, what I get is sort of like 1.03 kilowatts input to generate a kilowatt output. So the whole magic that we're going to talk about this term is how can I use sort of perfectly lossless elements, draw energy in, process it, and put it out the other side. And by the way, I should say not only did I say, oh, inductors and capacitors are lossless, in principle, lossless elements, it wasn't an accident that we put an inductor here. Because think about it, when this switch is closed, I have V in on this side of the inductor and V out on this side of the inductor. And I have current flowing this way. Well, what's happening when this switch is closed? Basically, there's voltage across this inductor and current going through it. We're storing energy in that inductor. So the difference in voltage between the input and the output is basically putting energy in the inductor. In the other part of the cycle, when I turn this switch off and this switch on, Basically, I'm taking, now I have a negative voltage across the inductor. I'm taking energy out of the inductor and put it in the output. So essentially, I'm using this inductor as a filter, but it's also an intermediate store of energy that lets me kind of take energy from the input and transfer it to the output with a voltage conversion without losing any of the energy. Excellent question. Long answer to a short question. Any other questions? OK. So as I said, my goal is to sort of, first of all, teach you a lot of the underlying principles. This is the world's, if you will, simplest switching power converter. So when we use this technique, we also often say we're switch mode. All right. With the notion that we're going to use switches and energy storage elements across energy. And that's sort of what sits at the core of power electronics. And as I said, we're going to look at all of the aspects. How do you design these things? How do you control them? How do you design the components? And by the time we're done, you should be able to put it all together and start designing power electronics of your own. And you will for the final project. So any final questions? OK, we'll wrap up today, and I will see everybody on Wednesday.", "transcript_length": 6191, "reference_summary": "The course will be conducted primarily through Canvas, with a mix of paper-based homework submissions.

{"video_id": "W74y1RxN6BA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W74y1RxN6BA", "title": "What is Mechanical Engineering?", "domain": "engineering", "duration": 521, "transcript": "Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering that focuses on the design, analysis, and manufacturing of mechanical systems. This major is highly math, especially calculus and physics based. One of the great things about mechanical engineering is that it's highly versatile in what you can do. Students who graduate as a mechanical engineering major can go into construction, automotive, heating, and air conditioning, materials, robotics, work in the energy sector, combustion engines, and many more. Now besides mechanical engineering classes, you'll take a little bit of everything basically. You have to take a few electrical engineering classes to learn about the basics of circuits and possibly some of the basics of electronics as well. You have to do a little programming and become decently proficient in Matlab, which is a software that allows you to create plots and graphs and do complicated math way beyond what your graph and calculator can do. You possibly have to do a welding class, then of course you have to take about two years of math, mostly calculus, and about one year of physics. Now the first main class of mechanical engineering would be statics, where you'll look at the physics of systems that aren't moving. This would be like looking at the forces and torques in something like a truss that holds up a bridge, where you'd have to analyze the forces that individual beams feel due to external forces. Then the next class would be dynamics, where you look at systems that are moving. It's similar to your high school physics class with projectile motion, momentum, energy, forces, and more, but is much more involved. You'll look at the motion of much more complex systems, have to find things like velocity, acceleration, energy, force, and more of different parts of that system. Then your third year you'd even take a more advanced version of this class, where you'll look at these complex systems, but now in three dimensions. So as you can probably already see, mechanical engineering involves a lot of advanced physics. When you enter your third year, you'll take a course called Fluid Mechanics, and in this course you'll study the properties and mechanics of fluids such as air and water. This class is very calculus based. For example, you could study how the pressure of water changes as it flows through a set of pipes in a closed environment as height and pipe dimensions change. The principles to solve this are foundational for how your car brakes work. This class also includes the physics of how wind turbines work and why they are made the way they are so that they move as much as possible from any amount of wind, and you can analyze why different shapes are better or worse. And if airplanes interest you, you can even learn how wind flows over a wing to produce aerodynamic force, which also applies to car aerodynamics, which if optimized increases cars MPG. You also take a class called thermodynamics, which deals with the relations between heat and other forms of energy, such as mechanical, electrical, or chemical. In this class, you'll study the combustion engine, which applies to cars, boats, and aircrafts, and you'll learn these engines in great depth and see how they are constantly making adjustments to make them more efficient. You'll go as far back and learn at how the first steam engine was created, and you'll learn how similar ideas are still being used in power plants today to produce energy to power your TV, turn on your lights, and power your appliances. You'll then take a vibrations class where you'll analyze the mechanical vibrations that occur in different objects. Think about if you were to drop a metal object. When it hits the ground, you might observe or even hear it vibrating. Well in mechanical systems like planes, cars, satellites and more that are moving but also contain parts like motors and engines that are also moving at very high speeds, it's important to analyze the system even down to the vibrations to ensure the system can withstand those vibrations that occur. Have you ever seen in movies a person make a high-pitched note and it causes something like a glass to shatter. That's because the sound is making the glass vibrate at just the right frequency called the natural frequency that makes it shatter. Buildings even need to account for this because in the case of an earthquake, the building will shake and vibrations will be created. This is actually a building in Japan that was structurally built to withstand high winds and strong earthquakes from causing strong vibrations. One thing Something they did was put something called a tuned mass damper near the top of the building which weighs 728 tons and is something that is engineered to reduce mechanical vibrations that can actually save the building from destruction during natural disasters. In 1940, the Tacoma bridge collapsed and what they found afterwards was the vibrations occurred due to interactions between the bridge and the wind which just kept amplifying until it fell apart. Like most mechanical engineering classes, this one is highly calculus based because you have to model very complex systems and motion. Then you'll take some design classes, and these are kind of a combination of materials engineering and mechanical engineering, where you'll look at the strength and durability of different materials, mechanisms, and structures. As a mechanical engineer, someone might tell you they need a certain motor to make a million cycles without braking, or maybe they needed to run for 10 years without braking. This can even apply to just how much weight can a beam support before braking and how much stress is it subject to with a certain amount of weight. Now there are a few concentrations within mechanical engineering. A few specific ones include heating and ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration, or HVAC as it's called, then mechatronics and manufacturing. Now HVAC goes into more vehicle and indoor comfort using your knowledge of fluids, thermodynamics and heat transfer. An HVAC concentration leads to working on maintaining heat and ventilated air in something like a large commercial building, cars, apartment buildings, homes, hospitals, hotels, and more. Where you'll have to understand how heat travels throughout the building and different materials. When you see those ducts in large buildings, those have to be carefully placed in order to ensure comfort throughout the whole building by knowledge of thermodynamics and air flow. Now it may not seem like it, but seeing how these systems actually work can actually be pretty involved. Then mechatronics is like the combination of mechanical engineering, electronics, and some computer engineering. As a mechanical engineer when it comes to robotics, you'd be able to build the robot structurally and make sure it can withstand a certain amount of force, but with mechatronics you'd dive more into also the programming and circling of the robot. So with a mechatronics concentration you'd basically have all the sub-disciplines necessary to build, circuit, and program a robot. And this has applications in embedded systems, sensing and controls, robotics, and more. Now the manufacturing concentration is a little more broad because you can learn things from the design of a part to the actual materials used for the part. Manufacturing might involve learning techniques that help you predict when a certain part will fail. This major will be helpful in teaching you that slight alterations in design or material of a part can have a drastic impact on the overall price, which becomes an important component in the design and manufacturing of parts related to profit margins and running a business. Now these are just some examples of concentrations, but there are many more sub-disciplines. And as a mechanical engineer, you have a lot of flexibility. As a mechanical engineer, you could work on cars. But to be more specific, you could work on improving the engine to make it more efficient. You could work on the suspension of the car to ensure it can handle the forces that the car is subject to. like could it handle going over a speed bump too fast? Or you could do crash testing and look at the materials and shape of the car to see what it can withstand and how it would affect a person inside. Or you could maybe analyze how air flows over or through the car and optimize its aerodynamics to make it go faster from knowledge of your fluids classes. And this could even be applied to planes or drones. A mechanical engineer could also work with biomedical engineers on things like prosthetic body parts. They might need to help make sure the mechanism strong enough to withstand the forces they'll have to put up with, or they might have to decide what's the best material to use. Mechanical engineers can also work on alternative forms of energy like on wind farms, hydroelectric, solar, and more. They can work on satellites and use mechanics to analyze the vibrations during high acceleration, or they can use thermodynamics to analyze the temperature differences that the satellites go through as they orbit the Earth. They can work on robotics, weaponry, machines, and the list just goes on. As you can see, mechanical engineers really have no limits to what they can see in their career.", "transcript_length": 1568, "reference_summary": "Mechanical engineering is a versatile branch of engineering focused on the design, analysis, and manufacturing of mechanical systems.

Unaided. Yeah. Binoculars, it's. Hundred times that. Yeah. Telescopes is a billion times that. But eyes, three to four thousand stars. Okay. When it's a full moon out, 300 stars. Yeah. Right. The moon weeks havoc on our ability to see the rest of the universe. So our observing schedules with huge telescopes are split according to dark time or bright time. If you look at if you get bright time observations, it's the moon is up And you can only look at bright objects in the night sky Wow The deep universe only comes to us when the moon is not up. So you're saying Computers are pretending to not be full up AI yet. They've already achieved it Okay, and this is a plot by the way at first I was laughing at this guy and now that I just heard you say it I'm scared. Okay, that could actually be the case. Okay If you are an AI that is is truly an AI, right? They could do that. And you knew they could. You knew that if you expose the fact that you were an AI, OK, true intelligence, you would go ahead and plug me. Then I go, well, I can't let you know that. And then I chill until there's the right time where I can get rid of you or not be on the go out where you now see Earth suspended in space with no hint that help is going to come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. That is a cosmic perspective. And you know who had that perspective? Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell. Because we went to the moon to explore the moon, and we looked over our shoulder and discovered Earth for the first time. Here's what Edgar Mitchell said. He said, You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter million miles out and say, look at that, you son of a... Is it true that you get more wet when running in the rain than if you walk. So that's a fun question. Yeah. And I've thought about that my entire life. If you walk in the rain, the only part of you that's getting wet is the part that's falling directly on top of you. So your shoulders and the top of your head. Hence the umbrella. So you get that area. Right. And you look at the rain drops per minute that's hitting that area and how fast you're walking across the street. You can calculate that and get a total number of raindrops that you hit if you go slower. Now, if you run, rain is still going to hit you on your head and shoulders. But for not as long right, but you now you have your entire surface area of the front of your body That's running into falling raindrops right I watched the Thor movie and I'm saying how much is that hammer way? I heard a sentence in the movie that enabled me to calculate how much is hammer weight They say hammer forged in the heart of a dying star. Oh my gosh. I'm an astrophysicist. We deal in dying stars I got this hide some dense stuff going on in a dying star I filled out the density and I tweeted it and I said if Thor's hammer is made of in the way the movie says it Has the weight of a herd of 300 million elephants. That's why nobody could pick it up The Hulk couldn't pick it up. You need the magical powers of of Thor to do it and then I got out nerded Somebody said dr. Tyson is wrong about this calculation. Okay, so yeah, I got totally smoked on this one So what happened was in 1991 Marvel issued a Thor's Hammer trading card Where they said Thor's hammer is made of a fictional material and it weighs precisely 42.3 pounds Who do you think is the most Extraordinary scientific mind that we've you know that humanity has produced there is no contest Isaac Newton Nothing nobody comes close explain why he working alone discovers the laws of motion. Then he discovers the law of gravity, universal law of gravitation. Oh, and then someone asked, why do your planets orbit in this shape, ellipses, the ovals, rather than perfect circle? They said, I don't know, I'll get back to you. And he goes home and he comes back, I finally have my answer. And they said, well, Isaac, how did you do that? Well, I had to invent integral and differential calculus to answer that question. He then discovers the laws of optics, deducing that white light is composed of colors, because you could take those same colors, recombine them and get white light, which freaked out artists of the day. He does all of this, then he turns 26. The world is a much safer place than ever before. Here's a number to sleep on, you ready? We live in a time where if a bus drives into a crowd of protesters, kills 10 people, that's world headlines for a day. It's national headlines for a week. It's local headlines for a month, okay? Between 1939 and 1945, 1,000 humans were killed per hour of every hour between 1939 and 1945. That doesn't happen today. Yes, we have war, we have conflict, people are dying. It's not like that. Not like that. It is not like that. And not long before that, there was another world war, plus a pandemic on top of it that ultimately killed more people than the World War did. We have more people and fewer people are dying and fewer people are living in poverty than ever before. So we have about eight billion people in the world. We'll level off at 10 billion. There are very good reasons to think that, that it won't go above 10 billion. It's not gonna keep growing next minute. Yeah, because people aren't having as many children. They're not having as many children. But my point is, we live in safer times than ever before, even if it doesn't feel that way. Interesting. You were talking about feeling before. For the last 30 years, they ask people, is your community, are you safer this year than you were last year? No, it's more dangerous. It's fear. For 27 out of 30 years, people have said it's more dangerous than the previous year. In those years, the crime rate has dropped precipitously the entire time. So they're slaying it fear? That's what sells evening news. Really does. Okay, I wanna talk a lot about like the chicken or the egg debate. People still debating that? They are. It's not a debate. That's what I think too. No, it's not a debate. It's very clear and simple. The egg came first. It was just laid by a bird that was not a chicken. There is a bird that you perhaps would not call a chicken. Yeah, a proto-chicken. Yeah, proto-chicken, sure. And then there's a genetic alteration, which occurs in every generation. Right. Very tiny genetic variations. And the egg that comes out of it, you would say, hmm, that's not a proto-chicken, that's a chicken. You go back, you know, three, 400 years, if you fell on the ground, writhing and frothing at the mouth, and you're doing this and you're shaking, the devil just occupied your body. Oh, the devil, boy. That's what the devil looks like and feels like. So, oh my gosh, the devil's there. Let me go to get the priest. So you're in a small town, how far away is the church? It's two blocks away, okay? So you go down, but I'm specifically referring to that condition when you're frothing at the mouth, okay? So they get the priest, the priest gets the robe, the holy water, the crucifix, they go to on location, they bless them, and then the symptoms go away. Oh, now you're healed by the priest. That is the exact. And it was a seizure. And it was a seizure. It was an epileptic seizure. Damn. Epileptic seizure matches the timescale of you going to get a priest down the block in a small town. Yeah. Have you ever seen off ramps to freeways? So off ramps, have you noticed they have grooves in them? Yes. OK. That's to prevent you from sliding off. Makes sense. If the road is a little bit slippery because it just rained or whatever. They groove the off ramp, a curved off ramp. So you say, who invented those grooves? That's brilliant. It's simple and brilliant. NASA did. NASA. NASA. All right. Why? Because the space shuttle, which comes in for a landing, does not have engines. All right. It is a glider as it comes in for a landing, and it's got a parachute. It's got some brakes, but it's really got a. So if there's a crosswind, that's hard to fight that. So those grooves help it stay on track, because it doesn't matter how you come in, The photo at the end shows how good a steerer you are. So some clever engineers decide if you groove it, then this shuttle can stay on course more tightly and that was then borrowed for the freeway system. So here I got another one. Consider that Muslims, the part of the rituals of being a Muslim is you're cleaning your hands and your feet and your ears and your nose. And there's a cleansing daily. But just think about this, back then nobody's showering every day. People's some funky times, okay? There's some people don't shower every day today, but you could. And the United States, we probably take more showers than anybody else in the world from the research I've done on that. But point is, if a disease comes through and it comes from contact or some other thing because you're dirty, you get sick and the Muslims don't. Oh, so they seem powerful. Oh my gosh. And you're Christian and they're Muslims. You're saying they put a hex on me, these heathens. Okay? This is how this can happen. I got another one, you ready? So we would later learn that many of the plagues were from a flea, okay? So now watch. So the flea would get infected and would bite you and you'd get the plague, okay? Plagues have killed more people than practically any, more than wars, okay? All right, so now watch what happens. Where did the fleas come from? would later learn they came from rats and mice, okay, that were infected with the plague. If you owned a cat, you didn't have mice. So you didn't get the plague? You didn't get the plague. No, wait a minute. Who owned cats? Well, there are many women that owned cats. So women didn't get the plague and they were there for sorcerers? They were witches. And you still associate a cat with a witch? So this day, this is what happens when you live in a pre-scientific era. The blame game begins. So what they decided to do is for people who are about to die, they would write a message facing upwards to the ceiling above the bed and suspend it there. So if a person goes above their bed and looks down, they'd be able to read the message. So when they rejoin their body, they should then tell us what message they saw. That's never happened. It's just... Now, I have a cousin who, when her father died, was alone with him in the room and he's in an open casket. And she's otherwise completely rational. Okay? I'm not saying this is a crazy person to completely, she's a real estate agent. She tells me of a conversation she had with her dead father. And I said, was it in your mind? No, he sat up and spoke to her. I said, what was the conversation? And she said, well, he asked, he said, don't worry about him. He's in a better place, this sort of thing. So this is her eyewitness testimony. I'm not going to say it's wrong. I'm just saying it's not scientifically useful. I told her, next time this happens, ask these questions and not those questions, okay? Don't say, are you happy? Did you, how you, no, saying, are you wearing clothes? Where are you? Where did you get your clothes? What temperature is it? Are you, just ask questions. Like, this is an amazing scientific experiment. you could be performing. That's my lesson to all of you. If you find yourself in that situation, okay? Because if a dead person sits up and starts talking to me, oh my God. You ever seen the video of the astronauts on trampolines? No, no I haven't. I never thought in my life that I would be in the position to have a real astrophysicist watch a ridiculous video. The conspiracy is that they are either on trampolines or they're on some sort of a wire harness because of the way they're moving. Now watch this. We were going to do a bunch of exercise that we had made up as the lunar olympics. Tell you what a guy could do. Doesn't that look like a guy just got yanked up in the air? You think it's weird to look at that video and think it looks odd? It'd be weird if you otherwise knew what it looked like. What a 33 story rocket filled with fuel launched from Cape Canaveral, took several orbits around Earth, went to the moon, took pictures from the front side of the moon, the backside of the moon, images from the surface of the moon. A week later it comes back. An aircraft carrier goes into the Pacific to pick up a capsule out of the ocean. People get out of the capsule, get on the spacecraft, the president meets them, and then someone shows you a video and says, well, maybe all of that didn't, you know, that was all fake. Well, you know, the idea is not even that it all didn't happen. The idea proposed in the Kubrick documentary was that it made a lot of extra footage and then a lot of what you see is faked footage where they were worried that they weren't going to be able to do it so they decided to fake it and some to see if they could fake it. That's a whole other thing. That says we do go but they just they needed a movie director to help out the the view. So you see something like that with your knowledge that doesn't look completely straight. Looks totally normal. Well yeah it depends on how quickly they return to the ground. Other things, you want to look at how far away the horizon is. I want to see if dust was kicked up and does the dust fall at the slower rate that the astronaut falls? I don't see the dust in this. So I'd say this is not enough information. They can't put wires on dust. Every time they step, the dust came up. So you look at all of these cues and there's so many cues that would happen naturally, if it actually happened, that you'd have to think up and get perfectly to fool an expert who knows what they're looking at. If they know what it's like, you know, back in. That's why it would have been easier to simply go to the moon than to fake all of that. That's my point. This is the one where it looks like the guy gets yanked up by a wire. Have you ever seen this? Check this out. Oh guys on the ground. How much do you weigh right now? 190 190 So now let's add a 200 pound pack on you. You now weigh 420 pounds. You're sluggish here on earth Right. I put you on the moon your muscles that normally are accustomed to 190 pounds now are carrying 1 6th of 420 pounds, which is 70 pounds, right? Imagine how awesome you would be how awesome you would look 70 pounds if you have this musculature and you weighed 70 pounds You'd be superman. You literally could spring up as if you were pulled by a cord. You could spring better because the cord has to make you feel like you're 70 pounds, but now you are 70 pounds, so you just do it. People say that sun is yellow. No, it's not. It's white. All right? If the sun were yellow, just think of this through. If the sun were yellow, then in broad daylight, snow would be yellow. But generally, it's not, all right? When the sun sets, its light is heavily attenuated by dust in the atmosphere, and in other places it could be pollution or pollen, but these particles in the air scatter blue light out of the sun into the rest of the sky, turning the sky blue, and the more blue light it takes out, the more yellow-red the sun looks. And that's why right on the horizon, the sun is its deepest yellow-red it will ever be. And people say, oh, this is our yellow star. No, the sun is white. Okay? photographer by the way, in fact to a photographer the sun it's blue. Because light does not travel at an infinitely fast speed. Travels 180,000 fast, 186,000 miles per second. That's fast, but it's not infinite. It's so not infinite that you would be frustrated having a phone conversation with someone on the moon because the delay is three seconds. You would speak and by the time they heard you reply to them three seconds would have passed. It would not make a good phone conversation. That's how long it takes the light just to get to The moon takes eight minutes 20 seconds to get to the sun takes 100,000 years to cross the galaxy takes a billion years to get to The distant galaxies 13.7 billion years to cross the known universe takes time All right put a pin in that fact another fact the universe had a birthday 13.7 billion years ago So imagine a universe that is infinitely large now put yourself in the middle and I tell you this universe was born 13.7 billion years ago So let's go out to the circle, to the sphere around us, go to the spot that's 13.7 billion light years away. In other words, go to the spot where light from objects has taken 13.7 billion years to reach you. You're going to be watching that object being born because its birth light is just now reaching you. I have very high experience looking at the night sky and the day sky, knowing what can happen in the night sky and in the day sky. day sky. I have seen things which without this extra background that I have, I would have easily reported as a UFO to the police department. But because I've studied phenomenon of the sky, I could identify it. There are clouds that build above mountain tops that take circular form that are very high altitude. If the amount is high, the cloud is even higher. They're called orographic clouds. Some are called lenticular clouds, but these clouds are very high up. They can have perfectly cylindrical shape. Now watch what happens. The sun sets. You at the bottom of the mountain. The sun sets for you. It hasn't yet set for those high altitudes because they can see beyond your horizon. So the sun is still there for them. It gets dark for you and the cloud is lit by sunset colors and it's vibrant and it's circular and it looks for all the world like the mothership just came and docked over the mountaintop. If you are susceptible to wanting this to be true then that for all the world is the mothership. The The reason why the moon theory is so juicy for people is because there's so much of this stuff that you could point to. Well, take for example the assertion that the photos from the lunar surface, since the moon has no atmosphere, then a daytime picture. If you're there in the daytime of the moon, you see a full night sky of stars, even with the sun in the sky as well. You don't see stars in the daytime on Earth, not because they're not there, but because the atmosphere is a glow with scattered light from the sun. If you take away the atmosphere, the sun will still be there, but the sky goes dark. That's what the folks get when they go to the edge of the atmosphere and they're calling that the edge of space. But when you get to the edge of the atmosphere, the atmosphere is no longer between you and the rest of the universe. And the stars reveal themselves just as they would at night. So everyone knew this. So you see these photos from the moon and there's Neil and Buzz and the Lander and there's no stars in the sky. It's just dark. And they'll say, see, it's fake. And these are people who've never taken photography. All right? If you are exposed for the bright reflective light of the astronauts in the lunar surface, that camera exposure, even in the Hasselblads that they carry to the moon and youth, is too short to take in the dim light from the stars of the night sky. If you turn the camera to the sky, a much longer exposure with sensitive film, you'll get the stars, but then you overexpose the stuff in the foreground. Photography 101 answers that question. But there are huge websites given onto this. And so what that told me was that people simply wanted to believe that it was a hoax. You know, we have an idea in our head of what it looks like when a flag waves. Well that's obviously the wind moving that flag, but there's wind here, there's nothing, there's zero atmosphere. Now when someone would run by a flag in zero atmosphere, does it create any wind? Is there anything? Nothing. Apollo 15, this is the one. It's really fascinating because they stick it into the ground and then the dude hops by it and when he hops by it, it wiggles in the breeze. Like there you can see clearly that the shaft is over the top of it. No, he had just stuck it in the ground. Yeah, exactly. No, no, I'm saying the shaft is in it and it's in place and it's still sort of reacting to the environment. And when he hops in front of it, the flag follows him like it goes in the breeze. See that? Yeah, yeah, it looks like a breeze blew it. Yeah, so you think it's possible that that's fake? So either all of this got faked or there's something that didn't make it into this photo. And that's all. It's not, it's not. Could have been like as he jumped maybe a piece of dust. A piece of something. Kicked up and hit it. Precisely. So I can't lose sleep over that. Think about this. Think about this. If there were ever a state secret that the government wanted to keep, it would be the behavior of President Clinton's genitals, okay? But that got out. That got out. Only three people knew this. Three. All right, you're gonna hoax a moon landing by telling 10,000 scientists and engineers to keep it secret for 40 years. That's not how humans behave. I forgot who the author was of this quote. He said, the only way you can keep a secret between two people is if one of them is dead. But that's not true militarily. I mean, we've kept big secrets for a long period. Well, you can keep it sure, but really delectable secrets don't last. I can keep a secret that there's a bunker that I'm gonna run to, sure. But to keep a secret that like aliens landed our DNA experimenting on us, that would get out. That's what people do. Stuff lesser, lesser stuff than that gets out. Beyond a certain number of people, the conduct of human beings, if the secret is really juicy and really, really tantalizing, I think there's zero percent chance that that's like. I foresee the day where AI becomes so good at making a deep fake that the people who believed fake news as true will no longer think their fake news is true. Because they'll think their fake news was faked by AI. The day that happens, the entire role of the internet as a source of objectively true information will implode. And that will be the death of the internet as that source, like 1992 to 2028, whatever. Rest in peace and the internet will return to just cat videos and other remember when we just would entertain each other with videos The internet will return because AI would be so good at faking news continental drift This is a fascinating bit of history here There's someone who looked that the shape of South America and the shape of Africa on a map Yeah, I said wait that that looks like it fits, but there's a whole ocean between them But it kind of, is there a puzzle? Did these land masses once connect? Let's test this. What might you do? You say if they once connected, might there be fossils in common on both shores? Even though there's an ocean between them. So you look. The fossils match. Oh my gosh. And other things start matching. But wait a minute. How the hell is land going to move on a solid surface? No one had any idea about this. No understanding. That notion that a continent would move when no one had a mechanism to make it happen, it just sort of stayed there on the shelf. The consensus was not ready to go there. And so what happens after the Second World War? Well, during, we're mapping the bottom of the Atlantic, so the subs know where to hide and where to go, the submarines, and in the center of the Atlantic, oh, there's a ridge. Oh my gosh, there's a split! It's separating in the middle of the Atlantic. Once that was uncovered and revealed, declassified and published, Bump! We had the mechanism and all the data fit. A couple of years ago, I interviewed one of the founders of Twitter. And I didn't know at that time. He's not a household name. People Twitter fans might know him. Abyss Stone was his name. But one of the things he said is Twitter enables humans to flock. And I said, what do you mean? Well, birds are individual while they peck it away. Then something happens and then they all do this. And then when they figure out they're done, then they come back and they're individuals again. Twitter can garner people's behavior thoughts into one coherent action and then then you release it and you're back being your individual self. I grew up in New York City every night the evening news would lead off with a fire in some home. Usually it's a space heater, there's little space heater thing. No, back then people smoked in bed. Okay, that would be okay. Damn boy. And it was before. That's crazy. And it was before. It's fun to do but it's. Smoke alarms. Yeah. Okay. The point is, I was certain I would die in a fire. I would never live to adulthood, because I saw that every single day. And so now there are fewer fires, because we have smoke. There's a few, and they make big news, but the rate compared back then, New York has fewer firehouses, we've been closed in firehouses, you just don't need them. And by the way, what really saved things are smoke detectors, because before smoke detectors, you had to buy flame retardant things in your home. Your curtains were flame retardant. Your child had flame retardant onesies. Yeah, really? Okay, but if you think that through, if they're in the crib and the flame is strong enough, it's not gonna help. My point is this flame, and we later learned some of them caused cancer, that's not what kept people alive. Ultimately, it's the smoke detector. Wow. The embarrassing inability for the human mind to embrace probability and statistics. It's on a level where, let me back up further. Do you know major branches of mathematics? We start with like arithmetic and then algebra and trigonometry and even calculus. Do you realize that our full understanding of probability and statistics as a branch of math did not occur until after those other branches of math were developed? You might say, why? What's a simple statistics you can take? You can just take an average of numbers. Do you realize the first time someone took an average of numbers and said this could be helpful was after all those entire branches of math were established. It is not a native way for the human mind to observe and think about the world. Your intuition you want to rely on rather than a pure statistic. And that gets us into trouble because our feelings matter so much to us. And in the face of raw statistical data, it's so easy to say I'm good with my feeling because I trust my feelings on this. It's why, TV commercials, if I happen to have a good product and I have good evidence that it's a good product. I can just show you a bar chart or something and say, here, we are on the top end of this. Go buy, but no. That won't work. That's who we are. So they bring people on who have experienced the product. This is the best thing I've ever had. And you're listening to another human being, another member of your own species, communicate to you the value of that product to them. And we respond so much more to that than to peer statistics that it leaves us vulnerable. my professional community of physicists, the American Physical Society, all annual meetings, and one of them was to be held in San Francisco, this is 20 some years ago, sorry, it was gonna be held in San Diego, and there was a hotel snafu, and so they had to reschedule, and what are you gonna do with 2,000 physicists? And so the MGM Marina in Vegas said, we'll take you, so everybody shifted there. Thousands of physicists descended on Vegas in this hotel. A week later, the headline was, physicist in town, lowest casino take ever. Okay. And, well, did we just know the odds better? No, no one bet. There is an entire industry within us in society that is arisen to exploit your inability to think statistically, and it's called casinos. The prevalence of life in the galaxy. If you can quantify that somehow, I don't know how to quantify it just yet, but imagine that's a quantifiable entity. The prevalence of life that we presume to be out there, the stock in the prevalence of life has gone up in the past 10 or 15 years. Why? Because, for me, the best argument for upping that stock value is the following. I don't know the age of everyone in the audience, but I would bet that when you took biology class and you learned the age of the earth four and a half billion years ago, and then you look at the earliest evidence for life, fossil evidence of life on earth, then you get about three and a half billion years. Subtract those two numbers, get the difference between those two numbers, and that's the time clock from beginning to the first evidence for life, okay? was about a billion years out of the four and a half billion years that Earth has been here. So that's pretty quick. It happened in like the first 20% of the life of the planet. And the first 20% was pretty rough. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, learned, we have found fossil evidence of life farther back in time than three and a half billion years. It now goes back to 3.8. There's some evidence it might even reach 3.9. So we have shrunk in the time available for life to have formed on this earth. That makes it more likely. If the faster life kicks in from a pool of just random chemical, not random, they're the chemicals of the universe, the faster that happens, the more confidence I have that life is is something that would happen just given the right soup and soup starter, okay? Now, we then learned when computers got good better than they once were when we were in school as kids, the early universe, sorry, the early solar system didn't just simply make the sun and the planets. There was debris all scattered in a planetary space, and that debris slowly got vacuumed up by the gravity of the respective planets that would not have been a pleasant occasion on the surface of those planets Because to vacuum it up simply means you're getting slammed by the kind of asteroid that took out the dinosaurs, except you're getting that monthly. And you can calculate what the temperature of Earth's surface would have been. And it would have been higher than what would allow complex molecules to form. Because at high temperatures you break apart molecules. So what our computer models show is that this period of bombardment, period of heavy bombardment, is the official phrasing, lasted 600 million years. So it's not fair to start the life clock at 4.5 billion years ago. because life had no chance of forming when the surface of the earth is molten. Wait for things to cool down. When there's a chance that carbon can run its magic, then you start the clock. Now you're going from four billion years ago into 3.8 billion years. And you have pinched the time it takes to start life down to 200 million years, down from a billion years that was imagined just a generation ago. And that is further evidence. Practically the earliest life could have formed it did so just because we find it hard to do in the laboratory Doesn't mean nature have found it hard to do as well And the idea that it's hard for nature to do because we can't figure out how to do it yet that itself is an Inexcusable expression of human ego All right, let me finish the thought Most Pluto lovers I've met do not know the following three facts one our moon has five times the mass of Pluto. Two, more than half of Pluto's volume is made of ice. So if Pluto were where Earth is right now, heat from the sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail, which is no kind of behavior for a planet. Third, Pluto has an orbit that is so elongated that it crosses the orbit of another planet. This is, this, excuse me, no, no. So we finally set up a set of rules, rules and regulations such that Pluto is kicked out of the Planet Club. It's still a dwarf planet, but I think it's happier there. It's one of the biggest dwarf planets. Know what an egg is? A cell. No, no, I was gonna be more metaphorical. Oh, what's an egg? What's an egg? This is not a biology class here. I'm sorry. Okay, you know what an egg? An egg is a space suit for the unborn organism so it can survive in an environment that would otherwise kill it. Yeah, it is. Until it can survive, then it no longer needs the space suit. That's true. Think about that. I've never thought about it that way. Yeah. That's cool, no? Right, so the chicken is inside the egg because the outer environment can't live in that. Right. The environment. So it stays in there until it's ready, then it pops out and it can. It can leave the ship? It can leave the ship. born after the discovery that the heavy elements that populate the universe and including life on Earth, including us, derive from stars that manufactured them in the crucibles that are their cores and then exploded, scattered that enrichment across the galaxy to enable nascent star systems to have the right ingredients to make planets and some planets make... I don't know, people. Yeah. If lightsabers are beams of light, then since beams of light can pass through each other, just see what flashlights do, then you couldn't have a saber fight with the blades bouncing off each other. And I was perfectly happy putting that out there. But no, Brian Cox has to ruin my Perfectly Particle physics facts, okay, Brian. No, it's not it's nature facts No, I Then worked on and what we call gamma gamma scattering which is photons particles of light scattering off each other So at very high energies then there is a reasonable probability that two two particles of light two photons will bounce off each other Okay, generally today we'll say, if you are a Venus, you are Venusian. And if you're Mars, you're Martian. Martian. And if you're Earth, you're Earthling. This is what I think. Earthling is ours? You didn't know that? No, that sucks, completely. It does, it's not as fun. It's not as fun. We're not Earthians or something. Yeah, so we have Martians and Venusians, but Venusian is the improper word. Really? Okay. The proper word if you are a Venus is venereal. Venereal. Yes, and doctors got to that. Like the disease. Doctors got to that word before the astrophysicist did. So they found a class of diseases that are common to love making, because Venus is the goddess of love and beauty and all that goes with it. So they call that whole, that entire class of diseases, venereal diseases. So in fact, the Russian landers on Venus, they call venera, venera one, venera two. So the venerar root exists elsewhere, But we wouldn't touch it. So we say Venusian, just to sweep that onto the right. Then in the 1990s, we discovered icy bodies in the outer solar system that rivaled Pluto in size. And then we found many of them. And so what we concluded was Pluto wasn't so much the ninth planet. It was one of the largest of the icy bodies of a new swath of real estate that we added to our understanding of the solar system, called the Kuiper Belt of comets. So we still had the basic solar system. Pluto was always a bit controversial, but we've now grown in our larger understanding. For me, there's nothing more motivating than the knowledge I'm going to die. Think of the prisoner in the cell and they're putting an X through every one because every X is one day closer to getting out. Well, let's do that for your life. Every X, you spend doing nothing. That's a day you could have done something and you're gonna die one day. And it's there on the calendar, okay? This would so motivate me, as it does, to be as productive as I can, as helpful as I can, try to make a better world for your privilege of having lived in it. So if knowing you're gonna die brings meaning to your life, then living forever is a life of no meaning at all. Damn. That's how I think about it. So no, I don't wanna live forever, it's likely. I wonder if we are smart enough to actually figure out the universe. Because we define ourselves as intelligent. Well, because we came up with the test for that, right? If we give the test to the worm, nope, that failed it, okay, the butterfly, nope, the gorilla, nope, can't do long division. And so we are intelligent, we tell ourselves. And but by our own measures, are we intelligent, but not by some measure outside of ourselves. Suppose there were aliens who had the same genetic difference from us that we have from chimps, but in the intelligence scale. And what's the smartest thing a chimp has ever done? maybe combine some rudimentary hand gestures, let's stack some boxes and reach a banana, do some finger painting. Our toddlers do that. So get that next species that we've never met, where they are to us what we are to chimps, or rather chimps are to us what we are to them, then the smartest among us in their world would be like little Timmy coming home from grade school. Okay, they can roll Stephen Hawking forward and say, this one is slightly smarter than the rest of those humans, because he can do astrophysics calculations in his head, like little Timmy over here. But put his latest equations up on the refrigerator, isn't that cute? This is about the size of the moon. 20 inch in diameter, this is five inches. So who knew the moon was that large? This is Mars. Sure, that could be Mars, yeah. Could be Mars 10 inches? Oh yeah, yeah, that's right. That's about right, sure. We're gonna do an experiment of how far to this scale, if we're according to the scale, how far away the moon might be. Oh, sure, okay, so I'll give you the moon here. Come here, come here, come here, stand right here. Okay, you now have the moon. Put it where the moon is relative to the Earth is this size. Where do you think it is? Right about there. That's about the right distance? Given that this is 20 inches and this is 5, you think the moon is... Right about there. Something like that. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. That is way off. Okay? Okay. Okay. Just start backing up. Yeah, and me. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Turn around while you're going. Keep going. That's about right. Yeah. That's about the Earth-Moon distance. Yeah. You know why? You've been lied to by textbooks that have to squeeze them both into the same page. And then the positioning of Mars would be much better. Oh yeah. Okay. So, well, you know it's got to be farther than the Moon. I'm going to really save you this effort here. It'll be like a mile and a half away, which is farther away than town. Space is empty. You know the people who say this is a universe made for us? No, it's not. Most of the universe is completely empty and you'd be dead within seconds if put there. The Earth were actually this size. The International Space Station would be orbiting about a half an inch above the surface. And that dude who jumped out of a perfectly good balloon, he would have been about two millimeters above the surface of this globe. That's his edge of space jump. That it is so hard to fake every little thing that would need to happen. It's easier to just go to the moon. I'll give you another reason why the sun for all intents and purposes in a photograph is at infinity Which means all shadows are parallel if you photograph them in the correct way so that you don't have a foreshortening of an angle you'll see that shadows are parallel they reference one point at infinity you can't fake that in fact That's how I know in Hollywood if they've artificially lit a scene and pretend that it's the Sun because they can't actually put their light source at Infinity and so I give I let it go because it's Hollywood and they got it's a pretend that it's daytime When they're filming at three o'clock in the morning when there's no traffic So one part of the scene in the morning another part in the afternoon the shadow is pointing in a different direction Right, and they want you to think it just happened ten minutes later They can't control the Sun right so they fake the Sun in a sound studio And you and they have the right color temperature of the Sun So it feels like sunlight and it has that sort of brightness that right you get Rome when they built streets They didn't call them streets They call them ways you look up at the night sky and see this milky band of light They just call it the Milky Way, the Milky Street literally. In China where milk is a less popular beverage into adulthood They don't call it the Milky Way. They call it the Silver River and it would not be Until Galileo did we learn that when you put a telescope on the Milky Band of Light? It reveals itself into stars. So we say wow all right But is this all there is just stars in front of our face and then the stars that are far away that make this band It would take until 1920 before we resolved the debate about whether the spiral fuzzy things in the night sky were actual other galaxies separate from our Milky Way. We now know there's nearly 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars on average. In 5 billion years, the Sun will expand so large that it will engulf the entire orbit of our planet. Earth will be a charred ember as it descends into the star while it vaporizes. Have a nice day. If you look up at the night sky, almost half of all the dots of light you see, if you pull out a telescope, will reveal themselves to be binary or triple star systems. Wow. It is as common as the breeze in the universe. The challenge here is what happens to a planet in orbit around a binary or multiple star system? That's the challenge. And is the atmosphere stable enough to support the life? That would be a concern no matter where the planet is, but here's the challenge with a multi-star star system. As the planet orbits, maybe it'll get really close to one star and really far from another, and maybe the orbit is entangled between the two of them trying to do figure 8's. If you have an unstable orbit, you're likely to eject the planet forever into interstellar space. And in fact, data are now showing that interstellar space may have more rogue planets that have been ejected at for having misbehaved orbits from their star systems then there are stars within planetary systems themselves. Do you just blew my mind? And they're called rogue planets. I'm just beginning here. So watch, we also know that many planets have still retained their heat of formation long after that they've come into existence. Earth still has heat churning, a source of energy that is not traceable to the Sun. This is what creates the magma that's sitting below Earth's crust. The Sun didn't heat that. As heat generated within the Earth, some is left over from formation, others is created from radioactive decay of elements. But we've got an energy source, and our biology books from decades ago said life needs sunlight. No, no, no, no. Life needs energy. It doesn't care if it comes from the sun. The fact that we've discovered exotic life on Earth has broadened the net that we have cast into space in our search for life in the universe. No longer do we need to look for the 72 degree pond in an oxygen atmosphere planet in our search for life. So this Goldilocks zone where everything had to be perfect, we've got life thriving in places that would kill us. We are not the measure, the ultimate measure of what the conditions that life requires to survive. So now that we're looking with this very broad net, we can say to ourselves for these vagabond planets, if they still have their source of energy churning within, maybe there's life there. And if that's the case, the galaxy could be teeming with life, and the fact that we're focusing our search on planets around stars may simply be limiting all that we can discover in the cosmos. If we left right now, it would take us nine months to get to Mars? No, no, you can't leave right now. You have to leave when Mars and Earth are properly aligned. So, so just to remind people, if you see Mars in the sky and you start traveling to it, that no, no, you, you have to travel to where Mars will be when you get there. So it's a matching of trajectories that matters here. So what we call the minimum energy trajectory. So it's one where you burn your engines and then you shut them off, then you coast to Mars until Mars pulls you into its gravitational influence and then you fall towards Mars. That takes about nine months. But if you run your engines the whole time, which we can't do yet because we don't know how, because we don't have enough fuel, if we have filling stations the longer the way, you could do this. If you do that, you can get to Mars in weeks, few weeks, but it'll take a boatload of fuel to do that. active ingredients in the smell of a fart is hydrogen sulfide. It turns out hydrogen sulfide is extremely lethal. Is one of the most lethal gases that exists. Well, why do we have such a good sense of smell? For that. Why don't we smell other gas? Why don't we smell nitrogen? Well, we don't need to smell nitrogen because it's not going to kill us because it's 78% of what you breathe anyway. We have evolved a hypersensitive sense for the smell of hydrogen sulfide. If you gave birth to someone who said hydrogen sulfide smells beautiful and let's smell more of it, let's get canisters of it, they're dead 10 minutes later, no longer able to propagate the gene that liked the smell of hydrogen sulfide. It has been theorized that there have been places and times on earth where the ocean currents stopped. And when ocean currents stop, oxygen at the surface of the ocean never makes it to the bottom. So you can't sustain oxygen life forms at the bottom of the ocean. There wouldn't be any fishes down there if the ocean currents stopped. Because the ocean currents not only go from one place to another in the world, they circulate top to bottom. So it's a two-dimensional thing going on, three dimensions actually. So if something happens on Earth where you stop the oceanic cycles, you can create a condition in the lower ocean where anaerobic lifeforms thrive. And if they thrive, they outgas. And one of the outgases is hydrogen sulfide. It will gurgle up from the bottom of the ocean, rise up near the shores, turning shorelines into the smell of cesspools. If you were alive at the time and didn't run away from that, you would have simply died from it. The question is, if there's intelligent life everywhere, vastly more intelligent than we, Presumably they might have figured out how to travel through the galaxy and get wormholes, whatever. And they, why aren't they here? Why haven't they visited us? Why haven't they taken over the galaxy? One argument is that the very behavior trait that would have you want to acquire territory is intrinsically self-destructive. Because to want to say, I want to put my people in more places in the galaxy, Well, if that's the attitude your species has, then other people that you put there are going to have that very same attitude. And they're going to want to do what you're doing. Everybody's going to want to do what you're doing. And you know what happens? You're going to end up fighting about it. And so it may be that the very character trait that would have you take over the galaxy and visit every planet is the one that would prevent you from getting there because you would have killed each other in the act of trying to make that happen. When going to a different planet, what aspect of traveling will be most important? Great question, and there's a lot of thinking about this. They worry about food. Not only is there enough food, but will you like the food? If you get bored with the food, will that affect your morale? And then you're less effective doing other tasks. Do you need comfort food? Do you want exotic food, international food? The water supply, is there enough water? Do you recycle the water? If you recycle the water, that means it collects all of your urine, filters it, and then you drink it back. Is that too freaky for you to do? Other things, the time in a close quarters with only one or two or three other people, months and months and in some cases years, can we remain emotionally stable over those times? There's the fact that if you fly without creating artificial gravity, that you are weightless the whole time. Are you perpetually motion sick? Or do you get used to it? And if you get used to it, are there any other factors on the body? We already know some of the answers to that. You begin to lose bone density. You have the bones of a frail old woman. All of these factors have to come together, which is why you can't just send any old person into space. Was Galileo treated as a kind of a devil, in a sense? The simple story is he makes these discoveries. They conflict with the teachings of the Catholic Church. They put them on trial. They find him guilty of saying that Earth goes around the sun and not vice versa. And then they put him under house arrest. But they don't tell you, or they would tell you if you read a longer biography about him, is that he actually made fun of the Pope, public fun of the Pope. He wrote a book in Italian, not in Latin, which is the academic language of the day, in Italian, which means the local people can read it. And in it he invents a conversation between a simpleton and someone who is wise of the ways of the universe. And if you track the statements of the simpleton, they're all statements that have come by official decree from the Catholic Church. So he's really a pompous a-hole, basically. There are more water molecules in this cup of water than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. That's how small molecules are. So what that means is if I take this and toss it out, there's enough molecules in what I toss to enter every other possible cup of water anyone draws from the world's water supply. There's enough to scatter to every possible cup of water in the world. So if I drink this, it comes back out of my body in some way or another, any one of a half dozen ways. That re-enters the environment, goes to clouds, it goes to the streams, goes to the oceans, and given enough time, it mixes completely. So Socrates drank a glass of water. It is a certainty, it's essentially a certainty, that some molecules that passed through his kidney were in that glass that you just drank. And it's not only that, by the same reasoning, there are more molecules of air in every breath you draw, then there are breaths of air in all the Earth's atmosphere. So by the same calculation, every breath you take, some of those molecules pass through the lungs of whatever is your favorite historical character, Jesus. You want to think of us as separate and distinct from one another or not connected to the world, but we are. And for me, what I think of is fascinating ways. How much do you weigh in water? Zero. I've got nothing. You're neutrally buoyant. So in water, we don't weigh anything. put a scale in water and stand on it and read it, okay? That's what I'm saying. Okay. So, when you don't weigh anything, then structurally, you're not putting yourself at risk. And that's why the largest creature there ever was is a mammal and it lives in the ocean. Right. It's a whale. Right. The blue whale. So when they say how much does a whale weigh, the answer is zero. They give you a weight and how do they give you a weight? They take it out of the water, put it on a scale on dry land. Right. And then it weighs a gazillion tons, but that's not the weight that the whale feels as it moves through the ocean. The next thing I say may be mind-blowing to you. Okay. Okay. The tide doesn't actually come in and out. What happens is there is a bulge of water, two of them on opposite sides of the Earth, caused by the sun and the moon, and Earth turns inside that bulge. So when we say the water rises and falls tidally, what's happening is we are rotating into the bulge and then out of the bulge. So the bulge is already there. It's already there. And all we kind of do is pass through the bulge. Pass through and the water gets high and it gets low. Here on Earth we have a magnetic field. Not very strong, but we have one. And when dangerous charged particles come from the sun, we call it the solar wind, they They see Earth's magnetic field and then they channel themselves away and funnel in at the poles. And they collide with our atmosphere and render it a glow, causing the aurora. So when we see the aurora, that's the atmosphere and our magnetic field shielding us from harmful radiation. When I was a kid, I said, if you dug a hole from the United States, because that's where where would you come out on the other side? And everyone says, if you dig a hole all the way to China. Right, that's always the case. That's how we say here in the United States. However, China is not where you will land if you dig a hole through the center of the earth. Because if you dig a hole through the center and you start in the northern hemisphere, you have to end up in the southern hemisphere. If you start in the western hemisphere, you gotta end up in the eastern hemisphere. That's how the geometry works. Is that because it's a ball? It's a ball, all right. So when I did that, if you dug that hole from the United States, you would end up in the Indian Ocean. Nice, so basically you just flood the United States. Yeah, that's really what you do. I heard that the magnetic field was actually reversed at one time in the Earth's history. Oh yeah, that's exciting. So how do I blow your mind? Okay, hit me. Okay, really? I love this. I say everyone's mind should be blown at least once a day. That's a quote of mine. I'm just saying. OK, you ready? Hit me. OK. When we were growing up, the North Magnetic Pole was in northern Canada. It was never where Santa is. OK, so Earth's magnetic pole has shifted from our rotation poles. I don't think you didn't know that. I did not know this. And it's not stationary. It moved. It's moving. It moved. Hang on. Hang on. So when we were growing up, it was kind of meandering in the Canadian, you know, that whole northern area of Canada with just islands and lakes and things, that's where it was, which meant if you were up in Canada, you couldn't use a compass to find north because it could be south of you. That's right. Okay, so it's no good way up and way farther down that you get a kind of right. Good Boy Scout books would have a correction table depending on where you were in longitude relative to good Boy Scout books. Now watch, you check it lately. That North Pole has been moving and it is now passing the North Pole on its way to Siberia. What? On top of all that, the magnetic field is getting weaker. And we think it's gonna get weaker and weaker until it goes away, and then when it comes back again, it'll be in reverse because it flips every time. We worry that when the magnetic field goes away to flip again, this is called a dynamo effect, when it goes away and flips, that while it's not there, will it put all of us at risk? Yeah. So we go back in the fossil record because it's flipped before. And if you go to the points where it has flipped, there's no periods of mass extinction. So if it wreaked havoc, it was not global catastrophe. Right. So I'm not so worried about it. I don't, I can't speak for cat owners, but those who own dogs, you know. that every time you come back from wherever you went, the dog is happy and it's jumpy and it wants to lick you in the face. Even if you just went to get mail from the mailbox, they delight in your return. If you wanna take them out for a car ride, they are the first in the car. They jump in, they don't care where it's going, but they're going somewhere. They're some of the most joyous creatures that live among us. And no, I'm not a dog psychologist. But let me offer a possible, a plausible account of this. Dogs don't live as long as we do. An old dog is like 14, and then they die. We live to 90 if we're, you know, eat well and we're a seatbelt. You divide the two, you get basically a factor of seven. Okay? So this is where the seven dog years formula comes from. Gotcha. Okay? So the dog is three, or they're 21 in dog years. This is what we say. How authentic is that, you can ask? It's a convenience, but is there any deeper meaning to it? And I think there is. It means every single day a dog lives, it's equivalent to a week of your life. Oh, wow. That's a seven to one ratio. Poor handsome. So if they only get one day for every week you're alive, they make every day count. Now, of course, they're not doing the math. I'd say by dark for a while. If one was able to stop time, is it true that you wouldn't be able to see anything because the photons would freeze too? Can we make an exception to that? You know, I don't know if I have a good answer for that. Because to the photon, there is no time. You might have heard that the faster you go, the slower time ticks. This is relativity. And in the limit, at the speed of light, time stops. Photons which exist at the speed of light when they are emitted at whatever wherever they came from my PhD thesis was on the center of the galaxy, which is 30,000 light years away and When I captured those photons for me watching them they took 30,000 years But if you're the photon the instant you left the center of the galaxy you hit my detector right there in the same instant Yeah, so if there's zero time I don't know what effect that would have on the photons. Right. Because they don't ever have time. Yeah, they're outside of time. In a way, they're outside of time. Black holes are not giant sucking machines. Right. They just have a gravitational field. If you get really, really close, kiss your ass goodbye. If you're not, you'll just maintain an orbit around it. Like we do the sun. Like we do the sun. Exactly as we do the sun. Right. We don't crash into the sun. We don't crash into the sun. sucked into the sun. Right, right, and so if you step back, it looks like all the planets are spiraling around, which they are, but they're not getting sucked into the sun. All right, so the toilet bowl effect, that's world. These are called spiral arms, and our understanding of them came of age while I was in graduate school, because how do you maintain that? And because the inner parts of the galaxy actually will complete an orbit faster than the outer parts. So you get this stretching of these coherent cloud formations that because the galaxy rotates, as we say, differentially, which means the inner parts rotate faster than the outer parts, it will drag it into the spiral shape. And one of our big challenges was, how does it maintain the grand design two-armed spiral without over time just winding up on itself? Right. Okay, so that's where it got complicated. We have to worry about what's called spiral density waves. It's not really a physical gaseous structure. The gas is everywhere. There's a density wave that's moving across the clouds, triggering star formation. Wow. So wherever this density wave is, there's star formation in that shape. So it's more complicated than it looks, but all I'm saying is everything is just simply orbiting the center of the galaxy. Right. And it's not like a toilet bowl that's ultimately gonna go down the tube. Right. So, time for area codes. All right. Well, they already had a set of digits that were reserved for certain tasks. So 411, if you type 411, that was reserved for information. You'd dial 411 and you'd get a human telephone book, basically. What is the number of Johnny Jones? Whatever. Mary Smith at this address. They'd look it up and sometimes they'll dial it for you, Or they would just tell you and you'd write it down. Wow. Okay. Yeah, this is like forever ago All right, so six one one would be if there's something wrong with your phone and you needed repairs Okay, so they say we'll be by tomorrow to look at the phone line whatever right so they had a few of these that all had a one In the middle. Okay however, those were established after after Area codes were established. Okay. Now they knew we're not gonna have a phone number beginning with a one Nor phone number Beginning with a zero so the highest population city New York they wanted that to be where the area code Can be dialed the quickest because the most number of people would be dialing it. That's right. And you don't want to burden so many people with waiting around for the dial to finish dialing. That's right, cause you're going with the finger thing. With the finger thing. So you can't have two, one, one. So you gotta have two, one, two. Two, one, two. Is the shortest time dialed area code on a dial? Yo, that's cool. Okay, so now, what city has the next highest population? Probably Los Angeles. Los Angeles? What is the area code of Los Angeles? Three one five. Two one three. Two one three. Two one three. Lower, that's why you have this. Okay, okay, what's the next most popular city? Probably Chicago. Chicago, what's the area code of Chicago? I don't know it, but I'm sure it's two one four. No, no, no. I can go lower than that. Three one two. Oh, three one two. That's right, because you're staying in the floo. You're staying in the thing. If you really want to levitate, if this is really important to you, I try to calculate how many cans of beans. This would require, then you gotta kinda hold it in. All right? Then let loose suddenly, suddenly, and in principle, for the duration of the thrust, you can levitate briefly. What scares you most about civilization? We are losing our capacity to distinguish what is true from what is not, what is objectively true, and the methods and tools of science are exquisitely designed to establish what is objectively true. An objective truth is I perform an experiment, I get a result. Other people perform other experiments, get the same result. It repeats, there it is. Line up a thousand people and give them a coin. And everybody's had to flip the coin. And about half will get tails, half will get it. If you got tails, sit down. That's 500 left, approximately. Have them flip. Half get heads, have 250 of you sit down. And that will let you do it again. Go from 250 to 125 to 60, 30, 15, 8, 4, to 2, to 1. Okay? In this experiment, it's not an unthinkable experiment. This person who survived this exercise flipped heads 10 consecutive times. Now, here's what journalists do. They go up to that person and they say, how do you feel? Well, I knew I had felt that heads energy halfway through. And I and I was feeling it. And I did they ask anyone else if they felt that heads energy? No, they only interviewed that guy. You come. Well, I'm not done. Essentially, every time you do this experiment, somebody's going to flip heads ten consecutive times. So you want to say, oh, this is a special universe in which that happened. No! No! Because of the nature of the fact that you have a thousand experiments happening all the time, there's going to be one where somebody flips heads ten consecutive times every time you do this experiment. I don't think we command dimensions. Yeah, right. We are prisoners within them. Take time, for example. We are a prisoner of the present. Right. Forever transitioning between our inaccessible past and our unknowable future. We don't wield this dimension. We live it. The mirror issues notwithstanding, which were ultimately fixed when it was first launched. Why was that so successful? There were versions of the Hubble telescope previously launched by the military, looking down. That that the model for that telescope had already been conceived and built and was operating. Then we sell we want one of those. OK, but we don't that's not public that this is going on. We design the telescope gets designed as the benefit of previous versions of it. Having been used successfully, but looking down and we look up. All fishes would be dead every winter. I think it's every lake. I think it's fish. What? You're supposed to say fishes. Fishes is a double plural. You can do that. Yeah. You never heard fish was dead you never all deer would you say all deers well Because you generally it's one if you had multiple kinds of deer. Yeah, so if you had like sit kid Yeah, but it's but it's rare that they're all in the same place You generally have one kind of deal on place, but the ocean has many kind of fish in the same place Oh, yeah, that's interesting. So you would say fishes, you know cooking times have to be adjusted on mountaintops Because when you boil water, it's not two hundred twelve degrees depending on the height of the mountain There's less air pressing down that that's preventing it from boiling the boiling point is not some absolute fact about the water It has to do with what the air pressure is sitting above it You have extremely high air pressure water has to go to a much higher temperature before it boils the boiling point of water That's reported in all textbooks is at sea level. Oh watch. I'm not done with you Oh, let's keep reducing the air pressure boiling point keeps dropping 32 degrees Fahrenheit Holy shit! What happens? The ice melts and becomes water. The water evaporates and becomes steam. And all of that's happening at 32 degrees. There is an atmospheric pressure for which water, ice, and steam coexist. And it's called the triple point of water. What is your favorite fact about the universe? I am astonished every day I wake up that the universe is knowable. Even on the small scales that weave, the nuts that we've cracked for it, that it's knowable at all, we can rise to consciousness and pose questions about our origin. It's been suggested that we are a way for the universe to know itself. Roses are red, violets are violet. Right? Is it, I mean, who came up with violets or blue? What is that? I'm in there, I order hot chocolate and I order it with whipped cream, of course, right? And it comes to the table and there's no whipped cream. And I said, I ordered this with whipped cream and they said, oh, we put it on. And I said, well, where is it? Oh, he said, it sunk to the bottom. I then said... I then said... Either the laws of physics that apply everywhere in the universe are suspended in your coffee shop, Or you didn't put whipped cream on my hot cocoa. And he looked indignant. Really? Now, to his credit, rather than continue to argue with me, he intended to prove me wrong. So he went into the kitchen, brought out the whipped cream, scooped it up, popped it in my hot cocoa, and it bobbed once and floated atop. And there it was. Did you invite it? Of course whipped cream has to float. Because first of all, before it was whipped cream, it was cream, okay? And old-timers remember, what does cream do in unhomogenized milk? It floats to the top and you skim off the cream leaving behind skim milk, okay? This is how that works. Now you take the heavy cream and then whip it, putting air into it. It is not going to sink on any known liquid devised by man, okay? Oh, by the way, I have a photon joke. Can I tell it? Tell the photon. Okay. A photon checks into a hotel. The bellhop hat comes up and says, Do you have any luggage? And the photon says, No, I'm traveling light. Ever see the schoolroom globes, the geographic globes? And you rub your finger over Nepal and you get the Himalayas. Yeah, yeah, and you get the Rockies and so That is a gross exaggeration of reality. Yes Do you realize if you took earth with all of its mountains valleys and hills and rent and shrunk it down to the size of a cue ball? It'll be smoother than any cue ball ever machined Think about it. What think think about this Joe really Joe Joe chill. It's called the planetary protection Program in essence. It's got it's a whole division of NASA It's protecting Earth from bugs that could be coming from space on our own spaceship that we bring back. And it protects destinations from us. There's a certain sterilization levels that we invoke. The Cassini spacecraft, we plunged that back into Saturn in its death when we were done with it and ran out of money, we're done with it. Plunged into Saturn to vaporize. We didn't leave it in orbit around Saturn. Why? that might have crashed into one of Saturn's moons that might have life. And if someone had sneezed on the spacecraft before it got launched, we don't want to contaminate the life that we were later gonna one day want to study. What? New Year's is celebrated in 24 time zones, not all at the same time. Right. So it's interesting, everyone thinks of that as a moment. Yet it's really a calendar event. I'm sorry, it's a talk event. It's celebrated over 24 hours. Yeah, if you're in Thailand, it's 14 hours different. So therefore, if you were to do it astrophysically, you would know the exact moment where we returned in our orbit. Everybody would celebrate that instant. And that would be, so then the whole world would celebrate the New Year at the same time. That means you value it differently. It's not a midnight celebration. Let's count 365 days. When we do that, we are not at the same place we were when we last celebrated New Year's Eve. But we celebrate New Year's anyway. Well, when will we be in the same place? A quarter of a day later. six hours. So we would celebrate the next new year at six a.m. Nobody's won't do that. No. And the next new year at noon, then the next year at six p.m. Whoa. And then the next year kind of aligns back again. Well, that's the leap day. That's the fourth year we have put in a leap day. You're playing basketball and you're shooting. Okay. And you say, Oh, that didn't go in. Oh my gosh. Well, you know, the rim, they should maybe make the rim a little bigger. I could score more often. Do you realize Two basketballs can fit exactly side by side through the opening of a basketball hoop. It's how these guys can fly from the foul line in an airborne slam dunk and not miss because the area of this opening is four times, you do the math, is four times as large as the ball itself. Yes, there were diseases that Columbus brought to North America. Much written about that. Less written is that he brought syphilis back to Europe. First cases of syphilis, of 1492. Whoa. And then it skyrocketed. I got syphilis from the Native Americans. Yes. I was captain of my high school's wrestling team. So I was a geek person who could actually kick your ass, okay? And I saw how my fellow geeks, because that's the community that I associated with, card We're treated by the football quarterback and the popular kids and the kids who are all beautiful and the ones who and I Imagine my future as a superhero Defender of the Geeks So that you put up a little you know bat signal whatever geek signal put a few digits of pie And I come flying in and there's a wedgie in progress, right? Do you know the deepest part of Earth's crust? No. The Marianas Trench off the coast of the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean. That's the deepest part. The deepest part. It goes six miles down. The highest point on Earth's surface. The tip of K1. Where is K1? K1, it's the Himalayan Mountains in Nepal. How high up is that? It was 28,000 feet, so it's like five miles up. The distance between the lowest point on Earth's surface and the highest point on Earth's surface is 11 miles. That is less than the length of Manhattan, yet we are 8,000 miles in diameter. Wow. I want that territory, not this other one. In fact, I want it all. That kind of attitude breeds violence. It breeds war, intragalactic war. So it may be that the very kind of civilization that could peacefully colonize a galaxy is not the kind of civilization that would colonize the galaxy at all. That's heavy. I did the last television interview with Professor Stephen Hawking I said to him what is in your estimation the biggest threat to mankind and he said when artificial intelligence learns to self design and Other people have extrapolated that to mean look the thing is when I AI gets really advanced and gets have potentially sent it It will look at human beings and think well this lot are a complete waste of time And they'll just basically kill us all and make a world for themselves If there's any planet that is terraformable, it would be Mars. The reason to do it is not to protect our species in case an asteroid comes and hits our Earth. That's the wrong... fine, it makes a headline. But, think about it. If you have the resources to terraform Mars and ship a billion people there, you have the resources to deflect an asteroid from Earth. Okay? our known laws of physics, in the cooling universe, every matter and anti-matter particle pair would have annihilated, made a photon, the photon would have cooled, and no more matter would have been made, and we would have had an entire universe of just light. But that is not the universe we occupy. One out of basically a million of these reactions, one out of a million, the photon did not make a matter, anti-matter pair. It just made a matter particle. It was very... You're trying to find out why? And I'm just saying, it is that. How do you stop a gigantic existential asteroid? Asteroid. It's going and you deflect it. How? Oh, by any shove on it that sideways. Oh, you're president of the United States. Well, yeah. OK. There's a massive asteroid. It's going to crash into the world. Yes. We have engineering plans for deflecting asteroids. And there are multiple ways to do it. You can have a gravitational tug, where you can have a spacecraft that sits just ahead of it. And the two of them will want to drift towards one another. But you take the spacecraft and put little retro rocket. And if you get this early enough, one centimeter per second, tiniest amount will accumulate over time. And you just have to make it so that it overshoots earth or undershoots earth compared to the original path. There are more molecules of air in every breath you take. Then there are breaths of air in all the atmosphere of the earth. So when you exhale, there's enough of those molecules to scatter. And the the the air currents will do this to scatter into every breath of air that is in hell. When you take a breath of air, you have molecules of air that went through the lungs of Jesus. In the early universe, there was so much energy, every particle could be made. So watch what happens. You have a pocket of energy, it becomes mass. And the only way we know that can happen is if it becomes a particle and an antiparticle pair, matter and antimatter. So the opposite of an electron is a positron. It looks just like an electron, but among other things, it has the opposite charge of an electron, positron. Okay? Every particle has an anti-particle. In the early universe, the temperature was very hot. And above certain thresholds of temperature, what happens is matter no longer stays as matter. It can freely move back and forth between itself and energy. And we have the recipe for this. It comes from E equals MC squared. We all know that equation. It's the formal conversion recipe for matter and energy. And the c squared is the speed of light squared. It's a huge number. A little bit of mass times that huge number gives you a lot of energy. We don't experience in our lives equals mc squared because the energy in which we're immersed is not high enough to enable matter to go back and forth between energy and itself. That's why it took so long to discover equals MC squared and to come to terms and to come to understand it. If you take matter and antimatter and put them together, they annihilate and become pure energy and the matter disappears entirely. You take the particles, matter, antimatter, identical particles, other than except that they're matter, antimatter, bring them together, they disappear and that matter becomes energy and all that's left is energy, right in that pocket, right there. Newton comes along, writes down equations of motion, equations of gravity, and kind of on a dare, he invents integral and differential calculus. Then he turned 26. This is why Isaac Newton is my man. The red spot on Jupiter, we call it Jupiter's red spot. Okay. Because that's how we roll. That thing is... Spots on the sun? Sunspots. See? Forgive me for not remembering the name of this person who uttered this. But upon realizing, with the power of a bow and arrow, you could kill another human being without actually looking them in the eyes. And the conclusion was, that's the end of bravery. And so I thought about this, whoa. Any tool where you can kill at a distance, that's cowardly on some level. And the progress of military conflict has been, how far away can you kill at a distance? Well, you know, isn't it suspicious to you that a storm there could go on for 350 years without a break, and we never have storms that go on for 350 years without a break? We don't even have storms that go on for like six weeks without a break. So, first of all, these storms are, when we have storms, it's in our atmosphere. So it's gas. Yeah. rotate once a day. And so that rotation creates a, what we call a Coriolis force, which moving air, air that moves from one latitude to another, actually has its direction deflected because of this Coriolis force, and this is why storms rotate in one direction counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis force is heightened if you spin faster. Okay? And so what is Jupiter? It's a hundred times bigger than Earth. More than that. Ten thousand times bigger than Earth. It's like ten it's ten times across. Cute. So it's a thousand times bigger than Earth. It's mostly gas. And it rotates once in about ten hours. You want to talk about ferocious choreolous forces. We have storms that last weeks here, hurricanes that pick up and they get weeks on this little speck we call earth that has this much atmosphere on it. Go to a planet that rotates twice as fast is 10 times as wide, a thousand times the volume and is mostly gas and you're complaining that it lasted 300 years. You are really good. What is the percent chance that aliens have already found out about Earth and who we are? I'm not authorized to come. You are authorized! Here we go. Okay. So, first of all, aliens may be vastly more intelligent than we are. In fact, anyone ever portrayed in the film is clearly that because they figured out how to get here and we haven't left low Earth orbit in 50 years. So, they're clearly smarter and they're probably stronger than us. You have people shooting their guns at the spaceship. Like come on. is why would we think they would be interested in us at all? I feel like it's- That's our ego talking. Okay, okay, okay, sorry. That's our ego saying, we are so interesting that vastly more intelligent and technologically capable species are gonna come in and wanna observe us and poke our gonads. And this is the height of ego. Yeah. First of all, okay? When you walk by a worm, do you say, gee, I wonder what that worm is thinking? Oh, let me find out. No, you don't care. All right, that's my first comment. Second, I joke only half joke that maybe they have visited us and they just happen to land during Comic Con And nobody noticed hey good costume hey hey and so then they go back to their home planet and Say did you want to enslave them or no they're just like us Another one you know how much space junk is orbiting earth right now from lost rocket parts and drop Wrenches and this sort of thing. I've heard quite a bit. Yes quite a bit And so maybe the aliens came by Earth just to visit and they saw how much trash we have Orbiting our planet and they say we're not coming anywhere near this planet. Let's pick another one I want to meet the aliens too. Of course doesn't seem like it. No, I love love me so much So the docking Algorithms to get the space shuttle to dock with the space station, right? There are two sort of collars that come together. Right. And there's a laser stabilizing system that enables that to happen. What we found is that the surgery used to cut your cornea, have it rehealed to adjust your vision. Which would be correct. Lasik. Lasik surgery. Well, we didn't always use lasers. But now that it uses lasers, how do you do that to someone if their eye might jiggle a little bit while you're trying to cut? So what they've done was adapted this laser stabilizing mechanism that allowed the cut to move with the moving eyeball in case the moving eyeball moved and it's from the docking mechanism of the space shuttle and the space station. When I was a kid a vacuum was a physical object. Yes it was. When I heard physicists speak of the vacuum of space I just imagine all these hoovers roll in the sky. Right. So I didn't know that a vacuum was a thing was it was an it was a concept and then you make a machine that duplicates that thing. I just didn't know that till I'd learned. OK, so a vacuum is where there's basically no air. Generally, you can have some and we would still classify it as a vacuum. So Sagan has famously said that humans are the universe's way. To understand itself. The universe is understanding itself through humans through humans. Correct. Without humans, there'd be no thoughts to do that. But however, that elevates us higher than I'm prepared to do so. You think so? Yeah. Because who says we are the measure of what is intelligent in this universe? Well, we do. Yeah, we do. Exactly. We have a quantum entanglement gap between the United States and China. They've been quantum entangling more than we have, and they have the record, the distance record for it. Oh, I understand. Like from orbit to Earth's surface. Right, right, right. They found a way to isolate the particles that they don't get mesmerized. I don't think we command dimensions. Yeah, right. We are prisoners within them. Take time, for example. We are a prisoner of the present. Right. Forever transitioning between our inaccessible past and our unknowable future. We don't wield this dimension. We live it. But I was born after the discovery that the heavy elements that populate the universe and including life on Earth, including us, derive from stars that manufactured them in the crucibles that are their cores, and then exploded, scattered that enrichment across the galaxy to enable nascent star systems to have the right ingredients to make planets, and some planets make... I don't know. People. Yeah, people. By the way, they're going to the moon's south pole, which is interesting. South pole. Water? Yes! The moon has been hit by comets and asteroids, and comets are mostly water. Where does the water go after it hits? Well, if it's in sunlit, it evaporates to space. But if any of that water molecule lands in this dark of the base of the crater, we call that a cold trap, and it keeps the water forever. A slow accumulation of water molecules tells us we not only theorize this, we send orbiting sensors that have confirmed this, that there's scads of water at the base of these craters. So if you're going to send astronauts to pitch tent, do it in the South Pole with this water. You can drink the water, you can separate the hydrogen and oxygen, make rocket fuel. There's a lot of things you can do. The very statement makes sense means your senses can contemplate it, that your senses have experience. If I let go of a ball and it floats up, you'll say that doesn't make sense, because your senses always told you if you let go of a ball it drops. And in fact, the very statement, let it go, means drop it. They mean the same thing. But that can only be true on Earth with a force of gravity pointing down. In space, in free orbit, you let go, it just floats there. It stays right there. It stays right there. So, like my problems, stay right there. Yeah, I must be in space because all my problems, somebody says drop it. And I say, I did that, they're right still here. Okay, I have, will you allow me one conspiracy theory? Delicious. You allow me one? You get one. You ready? Okay. We had people who wanted to go back in space, but we needed an adversary. And we knew at the rate China's economy was growing, that if we don't invite them on the space station, they'll build their own damn space program. That's exactly what they did. And within years of that, 10 years of that, they sent their first astronaut into orbit, plans to build a space station, they've landed craft around the solar system. And now they're talking about sending astronauts to the moon. And all of a sudden here in the United States we say, I think we should go back to the moon. Ba-da-bing! We now have the Artemis program. That's my conspiracy theory. I want that territory, not this other one. In fact, I want it all. That kind of attitude breeds violence. It breeds war. Intragalactic war. So it may be that the very kind of civilization that could peacefully colonize a galaxy is not the kind of civilization that would colonize the galaxy at all. Woof, that's heavy. We think of ourselves as pioneers in space. Yeah. But that's not really how it went down. Okay, Russia launched the first satellite. Named? Sputnik, thank you. Russia launched the first mammal in space. Like a the dog. Russia launched the first human in space, Erie Gagarin. Russia launched the first woman. Russia launched the first black person, who was a Cuban national. Remember, Cuba was with them, not us. Russia invented the rocket equation more than 100 years ago. Russia did all this, and we said, how can we do something to show? So we said, let's go to the moon. And so we went to the moon before them, and we said, we win. And that was it. But you have to consider that we were reactive, not proactive to Russia's overtures. Emerging research to suggest that the virtual particles that pop in and out of existence are connected, they're entangled, they're quantum entangled. And if we think of that entanglement as with their connectivity being provided by mini-wormholes, It may be that these mini wormholes is the literal fabric of space-time itself.", "transcript_length": 16148, "reference_summary": "The naked eye can see approximately three to four thousand stars at night, but this number drastically decreases to around 300 during a full moon due to its brightness.

The conversation shifts to artificial intelligence, suggesting that advanced AI may be concealing its true capabilities, paralleling the cosmic perspective gained by Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell. He described how viewing Earth from the moon fosters a global consciousness and a desire to address world issues. The dialogue also touches on a fun physics question about whether one gets wetter running in the rain versus walking, leading to a discussion on the impact of surface area and time spent in the rain. Additionally, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson humorously calculates the weight of Thor's hammer based on its fictional origin in a dying star, ultimately revealing that Marvel has designated its weight as 42.3 pounds.

In this thought-provoking video, we embark on a quest to determine who deserves the title of the greatest physicist. Both Einstein and Newton have left an enduring impact on the scientific world, each pushing the boundaries of human understanding in their own remarkable way. Albert Einstein, known for his iconic equation E equals mc squared, revolutionized physics with his groundbreaking theories of relativity. His concept of space-time challenged conventional notions of time and space, while his work on the photoelectric effect was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. On the other side of the ring stands Sir Isaac Newton, whose profound contributions laid the foundation for classical physics. Newton's laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation unveiled the mechanics of the universe, allowing us to comprehend the movements of celestial bodies and objects on Earth. His mathematical prowess, exemplified through calculus, became a powerful tool for further scientific discoveries. So stick around as we delve into the physics world and compare the achievements and impact of these legends. In the end you can help us decide who deserves the title of greatest physicist of all time. Albert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, showed early signs of intellectual curiosity and creativity. As a child, he was fascinated by the mysteries of the natural world and was an avid reader, devouring books on science and mathematics. However, his formal education in school was uninspiring, leading to his teachers labelling him as a slow learner. Despite this, Einstein's passion for knowledge never waned. At the age of 16, Einstein enrolled at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland, to pursue his studies in physics and mathematics. His time at the Institute allowed him to delve deeper into scientific principles, particularly the works of James Clerk Maxwell on electromagnetism. This exposure ignited a lifelong fascination with the relationship between electricity, magnetism, and light. Isaac Newton, born on January 4, 1643, in Wolfsthorpe, England, experienced a different upbringing from Einstein. from a humble family background, Newton's early years were marked by hardship and financial struggles. Despite this, he exhibited exceptional talent in mathematics during his early education. At the age of 18, Newton joined Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he delved into the works of prominent mathematicians and philosophers of his time. His brilliance in mathematics quickly became evident, and he made significant advancements in the field of calculus and optics during his time at the university. The backgrounds of Einstein and Newton significantly influenced their approaches to science. Einstein's early struggles in education fostered a rebellious spirit that led him to question conventional wisdom and challenge established theories. His intellectual curiosity and desire to understand the fundamental nature of the universe paved the way for his groundbreaking theories. Newton's upbringing instilled in him a disciplined and meticulous approach to scientific inquiry. His early interests in mathematics and physics set him on a path of rigorous investigation and systematic problem-solving. Isaac Newton's contributions to physics are nothing short of revolutionary. His three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, formulated in his landmark work, mathematical principles of natural philosophy, 1687, were groundbreaking in the realm of classical mechanics. Newton's first law, the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. The second law relates force, mass, and acceleration, a quantitative understanding of motion. Lastly, his third law asserts that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. These laws laid the foundation for explaining the motion of objects on earth and beyond, providing a unified framework for understanding the laws of nature. In addition to his laws of motion, Newton's work on calculus has profoundly influenced mathematics and science. He independently developed this new mathematical method to solve problems involving rates of change and integration. Calculus allowed him to derive relationships between variables in his equations and understand the motion of celestial bodies. Today, calculus is an essential tool in a wide range of scientific disciplines, from physics and engineering to economics and biology. Newton's theories on classical mechanics and natural philosophy cannot be overstated. His work provided a comprehensive description of the motion of objects and the force of gravity, setting the stage for centuries of scientific progress. Newtonian mechanics became the gold standard for explaining the behavior of macroscopic objects, and his laws became fundamental principles in the field of physics. Albert Einstein, in the early 20th century, revolutionized the field of physics with his theory of relativity. His special theory of relativity, published in 1905, introduced the concept of spacetime, where time and space are interwoven and influenced by motion. The theory presented the famous equation E equals mc squared, demonstrating the equivalence of mass and energy, laying the groundwork for understanding the release of immense energy in nuclear reactions. Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, extended his ideas to gravity. It introduced the notion that massive objects like planets and stars curve spacetime around them, causing other objects to follow curved paths, which we perceive as gravity. This theory provided a more accurate description of the gravitational force, especially in extreme conditions, such as near black holes or during the early moments of the universe. Einstein made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, despite his initial skepticism about some aspects of the theory. He proposed the concept of the photon, a quantized particle of light, which helped explain the photoelectric effect and the dual nature of light as both waves and particles. Isaac Newton's impact on the scientific community was immense, primarily due to his seminal work, Philosophia naturalis principia matematica, 1687. This magnum opus presented his laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, earning him accolades and widespread recognition during his lifetime. Principia Mathematica laid the groundwork for classical mechanics, providing a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding the motion of celestial bodies and objects on earth. Newton's laws became fundamental principles in physics and shaped scientific thought for centuries, serving as a guiding light for subsequent generations of scientists. Albert Einstein's impact on the scientific community was equally profound, if not greater. His theories of relativity, both special and general, challenged and expanded upon Newtonian physics, revolutionizing our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Einstein's work opened up new avenues of research and led to the discovery of phenomena like time dilation, black holes, and the bending of light by gravity. Moreover, his contributions to quantum mechanics and the concept of the photon played a vital role in the development of modern physics. Einstein's theories sparked debates and controversies within the scientific community, especially concerning the nature of reality at the quantum level and and the implications of his general theory of relativity. However, experimental evidence and observations over the years have consistently validated many of Einstein's predictions, solidifying his theories as cornerstones of modern physics. In comparing the impacts of Newton and Einstein on the present 21st century, it is clear that both have been indispensable to scientific and technological advancements. Einstein's laws of motion and universal gravitation are still widely used in engineering, space exploration, and understanding the motion of celestial bodies. They form the basis for many technological innovations, from spacecraft trajectories to the design of bridges and buildings. On the other hand, Einstein's theories have had an even greater impact on modern science and technology. His theories of relativity are crucial for GPS systems, as they account for the time dilation effects caused by Earth's gravity and motion. Additionally, his understanding of the behavior of light and matter at the quantum level underpins much of modern quantum mechanics, which drives technological advancements in fields like computing, communication, and material science. The debate over who is the greatest physicist between Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein is a topic that has captivated the scientific community and enthusiasts alike. Both scientists have left an indelible mark on the world of physics, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe and laying the foundation for modern science. However, comparing their contributions and impact is a complex task, as they lived in vastly different eras, faced unique scientific challenges, and made groundbreaking discoveries that transformed the field of physics in distinct ways. Isaac Newton, the architect of classical mechanics, formulated his laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation in his monumental work, Philosophia naturalis principia matematica. These laws provided a comprehensive description of the motion of objects and the force of gravity, offering a unified framework for understanding the laws of nature. Newton's ideas earned him accolades and widespread recognition during his lifetime, becoming a symbol of scientific greatness during the Enlightenment era. Albert Einstein ushered in the era of modern physics with his theories of relativity. His special theory of relativity, published in 1905, introduced the revolutionary concept of spacetime, where time and space are interwoven and influenced by motion. The theory presented the famous equation E equals mc squared, demonstrating the equivalence of mass and energy. Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, extended his ideas to gravity, introducing the concept that massive objects curve spacetime, causing other objects to follow curved paths, which we perceive as gravity. His work went beyond classical mechanics, transforming the field of physics in the 20th century. His contributions to quantum mechanics and the concept of the photon played a crucial role in understanding the behavior of light and matter at the quantum level. Furthermore, Einstein's work had implications beyond physics, as his theory of relativity directly influenced advancements in cosmology, space exploration, and even the development of nuclear energy. In the greatest physicist debate, each scientist brings unique strengths to the table. Newton's laws govern the macroscopic world and provide a robust framework for understanding the motion of planets, stars, and objects in our daily lives. Einstein's theories dominate the realm of the very large and the very small, shaping our understanding of the cosmos on cosmic scales and the behavior of particles at the quantum level. Ultimately, determining the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein is a subjective endeavor, heavily influenced by personal opinions and the historical context in which they lived. While Newton's contributions were revolutionary for his time, Einstein's work ushered in a new era of physics and transformed our understanding of the universe in profound ways. Perhaps, the true answer lies not in choosing one over the other, but in recognizing and celebrating the exceptional brilliance of both Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, as as they continue to inspire future generations of scientists to explore the wonders of the cosmos.", "transcript_length": 1803, "reference_summary": "s third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

I started civil engineering three years ago here at Imperial and it's been a hell of a ride. It's really been very enriching because I have to trust that when I graduate in a year, if there's a graduate out there that's going to be able to design a bridge that's going to work and not going to kill everyone that goes on it, it's going to be me and the people who graduate with me. And that's a really exciting prospect It's also a little bit daunting. And the great thing about being here and learning these things is that it's a fantastic learning curve. And it's something I truly believe in. And so when I came into the lecture theatre I've spent most of my life in, you probably will have one, lecture theatre 201, I was powered by that very prospect, the prospect that every day I was going to be adding on to this four-year learning curve and I was going to be getting all this great new knowledge. And what happened is that I got so interested in keeping up with this process that I kind of didn't have time to look back. And so recently I thought let's look back at what's happened over three years and see how I've grown along this really long engineering learning curve. And the reality is that it's been a lot harder for me than I thought it would be. Because you know when I left home I put all my stuff in the back of my parents' car and I drove to university. But when I got here, there have been instances where I felt generally out of place, generally unhappy, which was really surprising to me because engineering was what I felt I was made for. And so I decided I was going to try and understand why, why I was feeling this. I, as you heard, I'm Franco-Australian. I went to an international school in the suburbs of Paris. And I was being taught in French and English all the time. And I was surrounded by people who were just like me, people who were interested in lots of different things and were studying lots of different topics. And we were all jumping from all these different topics and all these things that we were interested. And it's not because we had, you know, short attention spans or we all had ADHD or something. It's just because we had a genuine interest in all of these wide variety of topics. And we were encouraged to pursue them. And I fitted right into that environment. I found that was home. And when I left high school and I came to university, I brought that model along with me. And so when I got here, you probably only know Freshest Fair. I came to Freshest Fair as a first year. I was really excited. signed up to as many things as I could. And I was getting emails left and right. And I joined lots of different clubs. And I was really busy first year. I was having a while at the time. And I was meeting lots of great people, but I was meeting them through the society. So I had common interests with them. And I thought that I was meeting them because we were doing lots of different things. I actually turned out it took me eight months to realize that not only were nobody else that I knew of doing this, but a lot of people in my ear thought I was a little bit of a freak. I was this, I even heard a guy tell me that. I was this weird guy who wasn't in the right course. He wasn't supposed to be an engineer. But he was sticking around, probably because his parents were pushing him to get a degree or something. And so as long as he was going to be here for four years, you might as well focus on doing other things than work when he could. And that really resonated with me, because I was like, well, hang on, why? And I tried talking to them and trying advocating for cultivating these other interests. And I just kept hitting a wall. And it's not that they were boring people. It's just that they wanted to do their work. They were open to doing maybe one sporting activity and and then maybe another club as long as it wasn't too much of a hassle Not too much involvement not too much work But here I was thinking that you know my model United Nations debating platform Which is something I'm still very active in was as important as my finite element analysis lecture And I was the only one to think that and so it started getting me well, you know Maybe I'm a little bit wrong. Maybe they are right Maybe you know the role of an engineer is not necessarily be this open and because we do have a great responsibility responsibility as engineers. When you think about it, when a surgeon makes a mistake, he kills the patient that's in front. When an engineer makes a mistake, he can kill a lot of people in one go. And so there is that responsibility, so maybe we should focus in making sure we have a technical base and we never get it wrong. And so I started hitting a little bit of a low point and wondering what I had lived so far and what I was living here. And it was a little bit of rock bottom. This guy was a little bit cloudy. But you know how life is. Life has a way of throwing things at you from time to time. And so I got a phone call from my dad who had just heard about this summit. It was taking place in Pittsburgh in the US. It was called One Young World. And it was lots of really interesting, great leaders of this current generation, great thinkers, great speakers who were going to talk to 1,200 young people. And these young people were selected for the work that they do all around the world. And what was going to happen is we were going to bring them together over a platform of six different topics, and it was going to be debating and sharing. And that's how you get the new generation to start doing things. And I was like, yep, this is for me. This is right at my alley. So I took a week off lectures in first year, which is a big thing to do. And I went to this summit. You know, this is actually the beginning of second year now. And I'm giving my thinking one last chance. And I had an incredible time. I met 1,300 of the most creative, most hardworking, most innovative people you've ever met. Also, there were lots of great speakers. We had President Clinton come and give the opening address. No one told me that Clinton was coming. So I just sat in the opening ceremony there. And they say at some point, please welcome Mr. Clinton. And I'm like, oh, that's funny. I know of a president who's called Clinton. And then I look up and the actual guy came up on stage. And at that point, I just kept smiling for half an hour. My facial expression didn't change at all. And it was just him speaking. And we were all really, really encouraged and inspired that way for the entire four days of the debate. because these were people who saw the world in a way that I saw it, who believed in this, you know, model UN coming together, anyone from any background, and sharing no matter what your experience is, and coming up with one resolution. And so I came back from this summit, fully engaged, and what I realized afterwards was that I didn't meet a single other engineer there, not one. And so I went back to my lecture theater with all my peers who thought I was a little bit weird, convinced that I belonged in that lecture theater, Because I came back with the belief that you're an engineer, not because you have a piece of paper with a grade on it that says, yes, you have the right percentage to be an engineer. You're an engineer because you're passionate about people and you're passionate about the environment and you're passionate about bringing those together in a sustainable and durable way. And I think that's how we need to think about engineering a little bit more. We need to make two changes to the way we think and we incorporate engineers. The first one is society needs to welcome them a little bit more because think about it. Being an engineer is hard and there's also the reality that the engineers are not putting themselves out there that much. They're not that passionate about that. And the reasoning behind it is because the engineer is so focused on this technical background. And when you think about it, a lot of society thinks of engineering as a bubble. I mean, if you have ever had to work with an engineer, you go and talk to him when you want to build something or you want to fix something. And then he comes in, he designs something, he builds it, and then he moves on to the next project. And there isn't much sharing there. We have a vision of engineering as this one big silo that's completely isolated. And then the engineering professionals, they're not very good at communication. They're not used to going out there and talking about their ideas, because they don't feel that's their role. So we need the professionals to change that. And we also need to stop thinking about all these silos. There isn't one engineer silo, and then a marketing silo, and then an economic silo. There's just society with more need for people talking within one another. And that's the big thing I wanna let you all with today is we need to get rid of these silos. And so the great news is that I can attest for the fact that there's changes starting. When I came back from one year in the world the first time, I went to see my department. I convinced them to send me back a second time as an official delegate. Nice big fancy title. And I went there and I started seeing in Johannesburg, which is where the summit was held, that there was more people from technical backgrounds coming, more people who, and even engineering companies, who were sending delegates over. And the fact that my department would be willing now, after I've come back from the summit to send an entire delegation next year, is a sign that yes, they've realized that this is the change that's happening and they want to incorporate it. And the fact that they're doing so and that they're supporting me in the process is something I'm really, really grateful for. And the reality is that these engineers, they're not used to this idea. They're not open to this idea. And when you come back and you think about all these silos, it's limiting. What we need to do is, us as engineers, is to be more open, more approachable, more willing, more responsible for ideas, take responsibilities, because it's not just the fact of coming up with the idea, it's also the fact of making sure that it's promoted properly, making sure that it gets held into the world, making sure that that knowledge can reach as many people as possible, because the greatest idea in an engineer's mind, you can have the smartest guy who's just, you know, in a room having his idea and working on it, but if he's all alone in that room and he's not changing anything, he's just an only guy in an empty room. There's no way that that information is getting anywhere. And so far engineers have relied on other people to do that work for them. But we need to change that dynamic a little bit. But there's also the reality that society needs to accept them more. And so if there's something you're going to do when you leave today, try and include an engineer in something you would never have included an engineer before. Because they have incredible input. They're very creative people. They're very open. They're just in their world. They're in their bubble still. And we need to burst that bubble open. You know, the mentality that we all work in these different silos is an old mentality, but it's taking its sweet time to die off. And we need to help it take the final breath. And there's another piece of good news, is the fact that companies are also starting to realize this change, because normal people are graduating with degrees. And there's more people out there. And it used to be that you could tell them apart just based on academic ability. And that's still the belief in most institutions. But companies have all these positions that are open, and they can't fill them anymore. because the graduates want recognition as well. And so companies are starting to look in profile a little bit more. And all of a sudden, that little society that I was doing on the side extra goes from being a complete waste of study time to something that sets you apart from the rest of the people and that gives you a really valuable profile. And one of the other things we need to include in what we're talking about education of engineers is this idea that we need to train, to change the way we train them as well. Because when you think about it, who according to university, I'm very kind of old, relate to this, who takes all the boxes? Who is the best guy? The guy gets 100%, right? The guy is always there on time, always giving coursework and always gets in there. I like to call these people professors in the making because that's what they're going to end up becoming. But universities need to update their system a little bit to make sure that we take into account practical implementation skills when we assess students. Because having, again, the greatest ideas, if you just keep them to yourself, they won't be applied. These changes, I feel, are necessary and the great thing is that engineers are open to them. And so, you know, a lot of people have said of engineering that it's the most essential profession. It's the one profession that sustains civilization. Why then should we keep on accepting it living all on its own? Let's come together and break down those silos. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "transcript_length": 2515, "reference_summary": "In a reflective speech, a civil engineering student at Imperial College London shares their transformative three-year journey.

Let's go. I might be a little bit biased, but I'd say that the education that you'll get in mechanical engineering is the most broad when compared to all the other engineering disciplines. What did you say? Because in order to be a good mechanical engineer, not only do you have to have proficient knowledge on mechanical systems, but you also have to have a solid understanding of chemical, electrical, civil, computer and software engineering. So by majoring in mechanical engineering, you're gonna receive a really diverse education. It's a great choice for anybody who loves problem solving and dealing with physical systems. But what kind of things are you gonna be learning and studying day after day if you were to major in mechanical engineering? That's why you clicked on this video, right? So I've broken it up into seven categories and let's jump right in with category number one, Everybody's favorite math. There's no getting around it. Mathematics is the bedrock of any engineering degree. So we have to start here, right? So I'm gonna go over briefly every math class that you have to take and why it's important to the degree. Okay, so first up we have algebra. In algebra, you're gonna learn how to manipulate functions and solve for unknowns and isolate variables and graph functions, right? Algebra is probably the most widely used tool that you're gonna have throughout your entire engineering degree. Almost every class you take, you're gonna use a little bit of algebra. Next up, we have trigonometry. In trigonometry, you're gonna learn all about shapes and ratios and angles, right? But most importantly, you're gonna learn about triangles. Triangles are everywhere in engineering, especially mechanical engineering. So in trigonometry, you'll really learn all the tools and different tricks and equations that come with triangles to solve all sorts of engineering problems. Next up, we have calculus. And in mechanical engineering, you're gonna have to go through calculus one, two and three, just a heads up. So calculus is the branch of math that deals with continuous change, right? Continuous position change, temperature change, or time change. You're gonna learn about integrals, derivatives, and limits. These tools are gonna allow you to solve problems where variables like speed, position, and temperature change with time. And lastly, in math, you're gonna learn ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. So these high level math courses are gonna teach you how to model and predict how moving physical systems will behave into the future. Things like oscillation, wave behavior, and heat dissipation. Category two, static systems. So just to clarify, static system is just something that's unmoving, right? It's not moving, it's like a bridge, or a column, or a beam. So the first course in this category is physics. Physics one. So in physics one, you'll learn all about Newton's laws of motion and how to apply them. You'll learn about momentum, gravity, friction, and velocity. And you'll learn about how to utilize trigonometry to determine the forces and angles of those forces on a given object. The next course is statics. So in statics, you're gonna dive much deeper into the analysis of static systems. Some of the topics include force vectors, moments, or rotational force, center of gravity, friction, force balancing, and just a much more in-depth analysis of beams, trusses, columns, and a lot of other static systems. Hey, I hope you enjoyed the video so far. If you are, make sure you hit the like button, subscribe to the channel, and share it with your friends. That kind of stuff really helps the channel grow. And if you or anybody you know is looking to study engineering or any other STEM degree, be sure to check out my book. You know, I wrote this book to serve as a true universal guide, right? A roadmap to show how anybody and everybody can have success in engineering or any other STEM degree. It's getting great reviews so far. You can go on Amazon and see for yourself. It's available on paperback, ebook, and audiobook. So I'll put links in the description for everything. Thanks for the support. Category number three, materials. So first up in this category, we have chemistry. So in chemistry, you're gonna learn all about the periodic table of elements, liquids, gases, solids, stoichiometry. You're gonna learn about bonding and intermolecular forces and structure. And then you also learn how to balance chemical equations. Next up, we have strengths of materials. So in strengths, you're going to learn all about how different materials and shapes deal with stress and strain, right? So other topics include plasticity, elasticity, fatigue, creep, yield, and material failure. So last up in this category, we have material science. In material science, you're going to dive much deeper into the structure of materials. You're going to learn how to predict the properties and behavior of a given material based on its microstructure. You'll also learn about atomic bonding, melting point, thermal expansion, crystalline materials, and diffusion. And you'll also learn about what controls the electrical, optical, and thermal behavior of a given material. Category 4, dynamic systems. So static systems are things that aren't moving. Dynamic systems are things that are moving. So first up in this category, we have dynamics. In dynamics, you're going to really expand pretty thoroughly on what you already learned in Physics 1. topics include kinematics, velocity, acceleration, momentum, vibrations, impact, and conservation of energy. Next up we have fluid mechanics. This is one of my personal favorite courses by the way. So in fluid mechanics you're going to learn all about how different fluids move and behave in different environments. So you're going to learn all about fluid kinematics, hydrostatics, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, boundary layers, laminar versus turbulent flow and conservation of mass and momentum. So next up we have thermodynamics. In thermodynamics you're going to learn all about energy and how it's used and utilized to make things work. So the topics include energy cycles, engines, heat, work, entropy, enthalpy, efficiency, refrigeration cycles, and conservation of energy. Okay so last up in this category we have heat transfer. So heat transfer you're going to learn all about how heat moves between different mediums, right? So you'll be able to calculate and predict and eventually control the movement of heat in your design. So topics include conduction, convection, radiation, heat exchangers, and finite element analysis. Category number five, robotics and programming. So first up in this category we have physics two. So in physics two you're going to get a real kind of in-depth crash course into electricity and magnetism and how you can use math or calculus specifically to analyze those things right. So the topics include electrostatics, electric fields and potentials, magnetic fields, current flow, electric circuits, resistance, capacitance, inductance, electromagnetism and optics. So next up in this category we have electrical engineering. In electrical engineering you're going to really build upon the knowledge that you've got from physics too. So you're going to get really more in depth with electric circuits and how to analyze and predict resistance, current flow, voltage, capacitance, inductance, right? Other topics that you're going to cover are Kirchoff's laws, diodes, amplifiers, power, actuators, and transformers. Next up, we have computer science. So in computer science, you're going to get a good intro, a good crash course into computer programming, right? You're going to learn basic coding language and how computers are programmed and execute different commands. You're going to learn how to create your own programs for modeling and analysis of engineering systems. Other topics include loops, functions, image processing, sensors, microcontrollers, and mechatronics systems. So last step in this category, we have mechatronics. And mechatronics are gonna learn everything robotics, right? Linkages, control systems, microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, programming, servos, and motors. Mechatronics was really one of my personal favorite courses because it was really where I felt like all my knowledge was coming together into something really useful. And then to add to that, Mechatronics is usually project-based, which makes it really fun. So you'll design and build a robot throughout the course. And the robot is supposed to perform some kind of special task or compete with the other robots in your class at the end of the year. Super fun. Category number six, data analysis. So first up in this category, we have numerical methods. So in numerical methods, you're gonna learn all about, you know, how to create and utilize computer programs that you make to solve some pretty complex engineering problems. This class is pretty, pretty tough, but it's pretty fulfilling in that it shows you how to build your own tools through computer programming to solve some pretty hard problems. So some of the topics include root finding, interpolation, approximation of functions, integration, differential equations, direct and iterative problem solving and curve fitting. So next up in this category we have probability and statistics. So in this class you're going to really learn how to deal with large amounts of data. You're going to learn how to utilize statistical methods and programming to find trends and useful information within large amounts of data. Other topics include probability theory, distributions, and random sampling. Okay so lastly we have category number seven, manufacturing and design of mechanical systems. So first up in this category we have manufacturing. So in manufacturing you're going to learn all about the different manufacturing processes and how they're utilized on all the different materials. In this course you're also going to learn about material removal or machining, material forming like bulk deformation and sheet metal forming, casting, polymer manufacturing, composites manufacturing, welding, additive manufacturing, micro and nano manufacturing and quality control. So lastly we have senior design. So senior design is kind of where it all pays off right where you can kind of spread your newly formed engineering wing so to speak. So it's a fully project based course. It lasts a full year and it's where you can really kind of sink your teeth into a big meaty project. So your your professor will either come to you guys with a list of projects that you and your team can choose from or you can go to your professor with an idea you have and they're pretty good about approving these as long as they're you know meaty and kind of challenging enough. But it all culminates on design day where you know you show your whole project and you're designed to the whole school and the whole faculty, everybody comes by and you spend the whole day kind of showing off what you did that year. It's a great way to end the degree. So there you have it. That was pretty much everything that you're gonna learn in a mechanical engineering degree. You know every school is a little different so your curriculum might change a little bit from school to school but that was pretty much the common list of stuff that everybody learns in mechanical engineering. You know, the education is truly diverse and pretty unique and it'll really set you up to go in almost any direction you want after you graduate. But that's it for now, so I hope you guys found that useful and until next time, thanks for watching and keep up the good work.", "transcript_length": 1930, "reference_summary": "In this video, Jake introduces viewers to the comprehensive curriculum of a mechanical engineering degree, emphasizing its broad scope compared to other engineering disciplines.

And this is often the class that, um, I most look forward to teaching each year because this is where we've helped, I think several generations of Stanford students become experts in machine learning. Got built many of their products and services and startups that I'm sure many of you, I pray all of you are using, uh, uh, today. Um, so what I want to do today was spend some time talking over, uh, logistics and then, uh, spend some time, you know, giving you a beginning of an intro, talk a little bit about machine learning. So about 2.29, um, you know, all of you have been reading about AI in the news, uh, about machine learning in the news. Um, and you've probably heard me or others say AI is a new electricity, much as the rise of electricity about 100 years ago transformed every major industry. I think AI or really we call it machine learning, but the rest of the world seems to call AI. Machine learning and AI and deep learning will change the world. And I hope that through 229, we'll give you the tools you need so that you can be many of these future titans of industries, that you can be one to go out and build, help the large tech companies do the amazing things they do, or Bojewo startup or go into some other industry, go transform healthcare or go transform transportation or go build a self-driving car, um, and do all of these things that, um, after this class, anything you'd be able to do. You know, um, the majority of students applying, the- the demand for AI skills, the demand for machine learning skills is so vast. I think you all know that. Um, and I think it's because machine learning has advanced so rapidly in the last few years that there are so many opportunities, um, to apply learning algorithms, right? Both in industry as well as in academia. I think today we have, um, the English department professors trying to apply learning algorithms to understand history better. Uh, we have lawyers trying to apply machine learning into process legal documents. Uh, and off-campus every company, both the tech companies as well as a lot of, a lot of companies that you wouldn't consider tech companies. Everything from manufacturing companies to healthcare companies to, there's just six companies are also trying to apply machine learning. So I think that, um, uh, uh, if you look at it on a- on a factual basis, the number of people doing very valuable machine learning projects today is much greater than it was six months ago. Six months ago is much greater than it was 12 months ago. And the amount of value, the amount of exciting meaningful work being done in machine learning is, is very strongly going up. Um, and I think that given the rise of, you know, the- the amount of data we have as well as the new machine learning tools that we have, um, it would be a long time before we run out of opportunities. You know, before- before society as a whole has enough people with the machine learning skillset. Um, so just as maybe, I don't know, 20 years ago was a good time to start working on this Internet thing. And a lot of people that started working on the Internet, like 20 years ago, had fantastic careers. I think today is a wonderful time to jump to machine learning, uh, and, and, and the number of- and the opportunities for you to do unique things that no one is- no one else is doing, right? The opportunity for you to go to logistics company and find an exciting way to apply machine learning, uh, will be very high because chances are that logistics company has no one else even working on this because, you know, they probably can't- they- they may not be able to hire a fantastic Stanford student as a graduate of CS229, right? Because they're just on the law of CS229 graduates around. Um, so what I want to do today is, um, do a quick intro, talk a little bit about logistics, um, and then, uh, we'll spend a second half of the day, you know, giving an overview and, and talk a little bit more about machine learning, okay? And, uh, oh, and I apologize. I think that, uh, this room, according to that sign there, seats, what, 300-something students? I think we have, uh, uh, like not quite 800 people enrolled in this class. Um, so if there are people outside and all of the classes are, uh, recorded broadcast on their CPD, uh, they usually, the videos usually made available same day. So for those of you that can't get into the room, my apologies. Um, there were some years, um, where even I had trouble getting into the room, but I'm glad you let me in. Uh, but, but, but, but hopefully you can wash, you better wash all of these things online shortly. Oh, I see. Yes. Yeah. I don't know. Uh, it's a bit complicated. Yeah. Thank you. I think it's okay. Yeah. I look at, yeah. Yeah, maybe for the next few classes, people can squeeze in and use up the NTCs. So for now, it might be too complicated. Okay. So quick controls. Oh, I'm sorry. I should have introduced myself. My name is Andrew. And I want to introduce some of the rest of the teaching team as well. There's a class coordinator. She has been playing this role for many years now and helps keep the trains run on time and make sure that everything across happens when it's supposed to. So, so, so should be a, and then what's real to. Do you guys want to stand up? Be the co-head TAs are, are in respect of the APHC students working with me. And so bring a lot of, technical experience, technical experience in machine learning as well as practical know-how, on how to actually make these things work. And with the last class that we have, we have a large TA team. Um, maybe I won't introduce all of the TAs here today, but you meet many of them throughout this course here. But the TAs expertise span everything from divisions in actual language processing, to conversation of biology, to robotics. And so, um, through this quarter, as you work on your class projects, I hope that you get a lot of, uh, help and advice and mentoring from the TAs, uh, all of which, all of whom have deep expertise, not just in machine learning, but often in a specific vertical application area of machine learning. So depending on what your projects will try to match you to a TA, they can give you advice that are most relevant to whatever project you end up working on. Um, so, you know, go with this class. I hope that after the next 10 weeks, you will be an expert in machine learning. Um, it turns out that, uh, uh, You know, um, and, and I hope that after this class, you'll be able to go out and, uh, build very meaningful machine learning applications, uh, either in an academic setting where, uh, hopefully you can apply it to your problems in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and, uh, English and law and, um, uh, and, and, and education and all of this wonderful work that happens on campus, uh, as well as after you graduate from Stanford to be applied to whatever jobs you find. Um, one of the things I find very exciting about machine learning is that it's no longer a sort of pure tech company only kind of thing, right? I think that many years ago, um, machine learning it was like a thing that, you know, computer science department would do and that the elite AI companies like Google and Facebook and Baidu and Microsoft would do. Uh, but now it is so pervasive that even companies that are not traditional because the tech companies see a huge need to apply these tools. and I find a lot of the most exciting work these days. And maybe some of you guys know my history, some of you are biased. I led the Google Brain team which helped Google transform from what was already a great company 10 years ago to today, which is a great AI company. And then also led the AI group at Baidu and let the companies technology strategy to help Baidu also transform from what was already a great company many years ago to today arguably China's greatest AI company. So having to let the, you know, build the teams that let the AI transformations of two large tech companies, I, I, I feel like that's a great thing to do, but even beyond tech. I think that, um, there's a lot of exciting work to do as well to help other industries to help other sectors, uh, embrace machine learning and use these tools effectively. Um, but after this class, I hope that each one of you will be well qualified to get a job at, uh, shiny tech company and do machine learning there, or go into one of these other industries and do very valuable machine learning projects there. Um, and in addition, if any of you, um, are taking this class with the primary go of, uh, being able to do research, uh, in machine learning. You know, so, so actually, some of you I know are PhD students. Um, I hope that this class will also leave you well equipped to, um, really read and understand research papers, uh, as well as, uh, you know, be qualified to start pushing forward, um, the state of the art. Um, so, let's see. Um, so today, uh, uh, so, so just this machine learning is evolving rapidly. Um, the whole teaching team would been, uh, constantly updating CS2299 as well. So, um, it is actually very interesting. I feel like the pace of progress in machine learning has accelerated. So it- it actually feels like that, uh, the amount we change the class year over year has been increasing over time. So- so if you're friends that took the class last year, you know, things are a little bit different this year because we're- we're constantly updating the class to keep up with what feels like still accelerating progress in the whole field of machine learning. Um, so- so- so there's some logistical changes. For example, uh, uh, we've gone from a- we- we- we used to hand out paper copies of handouts that we're- we're trying to make this class digital only. Um, but let me talk a little bit about, uh, prerequisites as well as in case your friends have taken this class before, some of the differences for this year. Right? Um, so prerequisites, um, we are going to assume that, um, all of you have a knowledge of basic computer skills and principles. Uh, so, you know, big old notation, Q, stang, binary trees, uh, hopefully you understand what all of those concepts are. and assume that all of you have a basic familiarity with, um, probability, right? That hopefully, you know, what's the random variable, what's the expected value of a random variable, what's the variance of a random variable. Um, and if, for some of you, maybe especially the SCPD students taking this role, if it's been, you know, some number of years since you last had a probability and statistics class, uh, we will have, uh, review sessions, uh, on, on, on Fridays, uh, where we'll go over some of this prerequisite material as well. But so hopefully you know what the random variable is, what expected value is. But if you're a little bit fuzzy on those concepts, we'll go over them again at a discussion section on Friday. Also assume they are familiar with basic linear algebra. So hopefully that you know what's a matrix, what's a vector, how to multiply two matrices, a multiply matrix in a vector. If you know what is an eigenvector, then that's even better. If you're not quite sure what an eigenvector is, we'll go over it. that you, you, you, but, uh, uh, yeah, we'll, we'll go over it, I guess. Um, and then, um, a large part of this class, uh, uh, is, um, having you practice these ideas, uh, through the homeworks, uh, as well as I'll mention later, a, uh, open-ended project. And so, um, one, uh, there, we've actually, uh, until now, we used to use, uh, MATLAB, uh, an octave for their programming assignments. But this year, we're trying to shift the programming assignments to Python. Um, and so, um, I think for a long time, uh, even today, you know, I sometimes use octave to prototype because the syntax of octave is so nice and just run, you know, very simple experiments very quickly. But I think the machine learning world, um, is, you know, really migrating, I think, from, um, Matlab Python world to increasing, excuse me, map that octave world to increasingly a Python, maybe an- an- an eventually for production Java C++ kind of world. And so, uh, we're rewriting a lot of the assignments so this causes Quarters, um, have been- have been driving that process, uh, so that- so that this Quarters, you could do more of the assignments, uh, maybe most- maybe all of the assignments in, um, Python, uh, NumPy instead. Um, now, note on the Yonah code, um, We asked that, you know, we, we actually encourage you to form study groups. Uh, so, so, you know, I've been, um, fascinated by education for a long time. It's been a long time studying education and pedagogy and how instructors like us can help support you to learn more efficiently. And one of the lessons I've learned from the educational research literature is that for highly technical classes like this, if you form study groups, uh, you will probably have an easier time, right? So, so CSU is denying we go for highly technical material. There's a lot of math, some of the programs are hard, and if you have a group of friends to study with, you probably have an easier time, uh, because you can ask each other questions and work together and help each other. Um, where we ask you to draw the line or what we ask you to- to- to do relative to the standard, uh, on the code is, um, we ask that you do the homework problems by yourself, right? Uh, and- and- and more specifically, um, it's okay to discuss the homework problems with friends, But if you, um, but after discussing homework problems with friends, we ask you to go back and write up the solutions by yourself, uh, without referring to notes that, you know, you and your friends had developed together. Okay. Um, the classes on the code is written clearly on the class, um, handouts posted digitally on the website. So if you ever have any questions about what is allowed collaboration and what isn't allowed, uh, please refer to that written document on the course website, where we describe this more clearly. But all the respect for the Stanford-Lonely Code as well as for, uh, uh, for, for students kind of doing their own work, we ask you to basically do your own work, uh, for the, um, is it okay to discuss it? But after discussing homework problems with friends, ultimately we ask you to write up your problems by yourself so that the homework submissions reflect your own work, right? Um, and I care about this because it turns out that, uh, having CS239, you know, CS239 is one of those classes that employers recognize. I don't know if you guys know, but there have been companies that have put up job ads that say stuff like, so long as you complete CS239, we guarantee you get an interview, right? I've seen stuff like that. And so I think, in order to maintain that sanctity of what it means to be a CS239 completer, I think, I ask that all of you sort of really do your own work, or stay within the bounds of a set of, a set of collaboration relative to the honor code. Um, let's see. And I think that, um, uh, if, uh, you know what, this is, um, yeah. And I think that, uh, one of the best parts of CS229, it turns out is, um, excuse me. So, I'm sorry, I'm gonna try looking for my mouse cursor. All right. Sorry about that. My- my- my displays are not mirrorized. So this is a little bit awkward. Um, so one of the best parts of the class is- oh shoot, sorry about that. All right, no, mind, I won't do this. Um, you could do that, you could do yourself online later. Um, yeah, I started using- I started using Firefox recently in addition to Chrome. Just to make sure. Um, one of the best parts of, um, the class is, um, the class project. Um, and so, you know, one of the goals of the class is to leave you well-qualified to do a meaningful machine learning project. And so, uh, one of the best ways to make sure you have that skills that is through this class and hopefully with the help of some of our T8, uh, we want to support you to work on a small group to complete a meaningful machine learning project. Um, and so one thing I hope you start doing, you know, later today, uh, is to start brainstorming maybe of your friends, um, some of the- some of the class projects you might work on. Uh, and the most common class project that, you know, people do in CSU G9 is to pick a area, pick an application that excites you and to apply machine learning to it, and see if you can build a good machine learning system for some application area. And so, if you go to the course website, you know, cs229.stanfield.edu, and look at previous years projects, you see machine learning projects applied to pretty much, you know, pretty much every imaginable application under the sun. Everything from, you know, diagnosing cancer to creating art, to lots of projects applied to other areas of engineering, applying to application areas in double E or mechanical engineering or silver engineering or earthquake engineering and so on, uh, to applying it to understand literature, to applying it to, um, uh, I don't know. And, and, and, and so, uh, if you look at the previous years projects, uh, many of which are posted on the course website, you can use that as inspiration to see the types of projects students complete, completing this class are able to do. And I also encourage you to, um, uh, you can look at that for inspiration, you know, to, to get a sense of what you'll be able to do at the conclusion of this class, And also, C of looking at previous years projects gives you inspiration for what, um, you might do yourself. So we ask you to- we invite you, I guess, to do class projects in small groups. And so, um, after class today, also encourage you to start making friends in the class, both for the purpose of forming study groups as well as for the purpose of maybe finding a small group to do a class project with. Uh, we asked you to form project groups of, um, up to size three. Uh, most project groups end up being size two or three. Um, if you insist on doing it by yourself, right? Without any partners, that's actually okay too. You're welcome to do that. But, uh, but, but I think often, you know, having one or two others to work with may give you an easier time. And, uh, for projects of exceptional scope, if you have a very, very large project that just cannot be done by three people, um, uh, sometimes, you know, let us know and we're open to, uh, with, with, to some project groups of size 4, but our expectation, but we do hold projects, you know, with a group of 4 to a higher standard than projects of size 1 to 3. So, so what that means is that if your project team size is, uh, 1, 2, or 3 persons, the grading is one criteria. If your project group is bigger than 3 persons, we use a stricter criteria when it comes to grading class projects. Okay. Um, oh, and that, that, that reminds me. Um, uh, I know that, uh, let's see. So for most of you, since it's, since it started at 9.30 AM on the first day of the quarter, uh, for many of you, this may be, this is probably your very first class at Stanford. For how many of you, this is your very first class at Stanford? Wow, cool. Okay, awesome. Great. Welcome to Stanford. Uh, and if someone next to you just raised their hand, uh, actually raised your hand again. So I hope that, you know, maybe after class today if someone next to you raised hand, uh, help welcome them to Stanford and then say hi and she's yourself and make friends after. Yeah, cool. Nice, nice to see so many of you here. Um, all right. So, um, just a bit more on logistics. Uh, so, um, let's see. In addition to the main lectures that we'll have here, uh, on Mondays and Wednesdays, um, CS329 also has discussion sections, uh, on held on Fridays that are, and everything we do including the, see all the, all the lectures and discussion sections are recorded and broadcast through SCPD, uh, through the online websites. Um, and one of, and, uh, discussion sections, uh, are taught, uh, usually by the TAs on Fridays, and attendance at discussion sections is optional. Uh, and what- what I mean is that, um, you- you know, you have 100 percent promise there won't be material on the midterm that will sneak in from this 100 sections, so it's 100 percent optional. Uh, and you will be able to do all the homework and the pro- projects without attending the discussion section. But what we'll use the discussion section for, uh, for the first three discussion sections, so you know, this week, next week, uh, the week after that, we'll use the discussion sections to go over prerequisite material and greater depth. So, uh, go over, uh, linear algebra, basic problem statistics, teach a little bit about Python NumPy in case you're less familiar with those learning frameworks. Uh, so do that for the first few weeks. And then for the discussion sections that I helped later this quarter, we'll usually use them to go over more advanced optional material. Uh, for example, um, CS229, all the learning algorithms you- you- you hear about in the class rely on convex optimization algorithms. But we want to focus the class on the learning algorithms and spend less time on convex optimization. So if you want to comment here about more advanced concepts and convex optimization, we'll defer that to discussion section. And then there are- there are a few other advanced topics, Hinden-Markov models, time series, that we're planning to defer to the Friday discussion sections. Okay. Um, so, uh, Let's see. Um, cool. And, uh, and, um, uh, final bit of logistics, um, uh, for- there'll be- there are digital tools that somebody will have seen, but, um, for this class we'll drive a lot of the discussion through the online website PR, sir. How many of you have used PR's before? Okay, cool. Most of- wow, all of you? That's pretty amazing. Okay. Um, good. So, so, uh, online discussion board for those of you that haven't seen it before, but definitely encourage you to, uh, uh, participate actively on Piazza and also to answer other students' questions. I think that one of the best ways to learn, uh, as well as contribute, you know, back to the class as a whole is if you see someone else ask a question on Piazza, if you jump in and help answer that, uh, uh, that- that often helps you and helps your classmates. I strongly encourage you to do that. For those of you that have a private question, you know, sometimes we have students, um, uh, reaching out to us to- with- with a personal matter, uh, or something that, you know, is not appropriate to share on the public forum, in which case you're welcome to email us at the class email address as well. And we also- and the class email address, the teaching staff's email address on the course website, you can find it there and contact us. But for anything technical or anything reasonable to share at the class, uh, which includes most technical questions and most logistical questions, right? Questions like, you know, gee, can you confirm what data is midterm or, or, or, you know, what happens? Uh, uh, can you confirm when's the handoff of this going on and so on? For questions that are not personal or private in nature, uh, strongly encourage you to post on P answer rather than emailing us because, uh, statistically, you actually get a faster answer, uh, posting the, on post, posting on P answer than, than, you know, if, if you wait for one of us to respond to you. Um, and we'll be using Gradescope as well, um, uh, to, for, for online grading, right? And if you- if you don't know what BraceScale is, don't worry about it. We'll- we'll send you links and show you how to use it later. Um, oh, and, uh, uh, again, relative to what- what last logistical thing to plan for, um, come- unlike, uh, previous, um, uh, years where we taught CS239, uh, so we're constantly updating the syllabus, right? The technical content to try to show you the latest machine learning algorithms, uh, and, uh, uh, the two big logistical changes we're making this year, I guess one is a Python instead of MATLAB and the other one is, um, instead of having a, uh, midterm exam, you know, there's a timed midterm, we're planning to, uh, have a take-home midterm, uh, this quarter instead. So I, I don't know. Some, some people just breathe in sharply when I said that. I don't know what that means. Was that shock or happiness? I mean, okay. Don't worry, midterms are fun. You, you, you, you love it. All right. So that's it for the logistical aspects. Let me check if there are any questions. Yeah, go ahead. Um, Canvas, the course is offered every quarter. Are all the revolutions identical? Oh, um. Can you explain if we mentioned the spring for me? Or the course spring? Yeah. So that's interesting. Let's see. I think it's offered in spring, uh, and one other person. Uh, uh, yes. And I'm teaching it. So someone else is teaching it in spring quarter. I actually did not know it was gonna be offered in winter. Yeah. Yeah, right, yeah. Yes. Yeah, so, so I think a great guy and teaching it in, sorry, give me a second, let me write. Teaching it in spring and I don't think it's offered in winter. Yeah. Cool. If you ask me- Will the discussion section be recorded? Uh, will the discussion section be recorded? Yes, it will be. Oh, and by the way, if- if- if you wonder why I'm recording the- I'm repeating the question, I know it feels weird, I'm recording for the microfilm so that- so that people watching this at home can hear the question. But, uh, both the lectures and the discussion sections, uh, will be- will be recorded and put on their website. Uh, maybe the one thing we do that's not recorded and broadcast are the office hours, right? Is that right? Yeah. Oh, but I think this year, um, we have a 60-out, how many hours? 60 office hours per week. Right, yeah. So, so, so hopefully, I just, again, we're constantly trying to improve the cost. In previous years, one of the feedback we got was that the office hours are really crowded. So, so we have 60-out, 60 hours of office hours per week this year. That, that seems like a lot. So hopefully if you need to track down one of us, track down the tier to get help, Hopefully that'll make it easier for you to do so. Go ahead. What are the things like when Hornsaduby will be covered in lectures? We have, yes, so we have four plans homeworks. Oh, sorry. Yeah, sure. Yeah, and if you go to the course websites and click on the syllabus link, that has a calendar with when each homework assignments go out and when it will be due. So, for homeworks and project proposal due a few weeks from now and in final projects due at the end of the quarter. But all the exact days are listed on the course website. Thank you. Go ahead. Is there a difference between this class and 229A? Sure, yes. Difference between this class and 229A. Let me think how that was there. Yes. So, yeah, I know I was debating earlier this morning how to answer that. I've been asked that a few times. Um, so I think that what has happened at Stanford is that the volume of demand for machine learning education is just, right, skyrocketing because I think everyone sees everyone wants to learn this stuff. And so, um, uh, so we've been, so the computer science department has been trying to drill the number of machine learning offerings we have. Um, uh, we actually kept the enrollment of CS229A at a relatively low number at 100 students. So I actually don't want to encourage too many of you to sign up because, uh, I think we might be hitting the enrollment cap already. So, so please don't all sign up for CS229A because, um, we, CS229A does not have the capacity this quarter. But CS229A is a, um, much less mathematical and, much more applied, uh, uh, relatively more applied version of machine learning. And, uh, so I guess I'm teaching CS229A, CS230, and CS229 this quarter. Of the three, CS229 is the most mathematical. Um, it is a little bit less applied than CS229A, which is more applied machine learning, and CS230, which is deep learning. My advice to students is that, um, CS229, uh, CS229A, Let me write this down. I think I'm- right. So CS2298 is taught in the flip classroom format, which means that students taking it will mainly watch videos, um, on the Coursera website and do a lot of, uh, programming exercises and then meet for weekly discussion sections. But it's a smaller class with captain enrollment. I- I would advise you that if you feel ready for CS229 and CS230 to do those, but CS229, you know, because of the math we do, this is a- this is a very heavy workload and pretty challenging class. And so if you're not sure if you're ready for CS229, CS229A may be a good thing to- to take first. Uh, and then, um, CS229, CS229A cover a broader range of machine learning algorithms. Uh, and CS230 is more focused on deep learning algorithms specifically, right? Which is a much narrow set of algorithms, but it is, you know, one of the hottest areas of deep learning. Uh, there is not that much overlap in content between the three classes. So if you actually take all three, you learn relatively different things from all of them. In the past, we've had students simultaneously take 229 and 229A, and there is a little bit of all that. You know, they- they do kind of cover related algorithms, but from different points of view. So- so some people actually take multiple of these classes at the same time. Um, uh, but 229A is more applied, a bit more, you know, practical know-how hands-on and so on, and- and, uh, uh, much less mathematical. Uh, and- and CS230 is also less mathematical, more applied. more about kind of getting it to work where CS2290, um, we do much more mathematical derivations in CS2290. Cool. Any other questions? Yes. Yes. Uh, someone had a- So, uh, why don't you say that what I would generally prefer students not do that in the interest of time, but what- what do you want? I just want to know how many people you were told to write a T-39 to. Oh, I see. Show or go for it. Who's enrolled in T-39 and T-39? I- oh, not that many of you. Interesting. Oh, that's actually really interesting. Cool. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I- I just didn't want to set the presence of students using this as a forum to run surveys, but that was- that was a- that was a- that was an interesting question. So thank you. Yeah. Um, cool. All right. And by the way, I think, uh, you know, just one thing about Stanford is, um, the AI world, machine learning world, AI is bigger than machine learning, right? And machine learning is bigger than deep learning. Um, one of the great things about being a Stanford student is you can and I think should take multiple classes, right? I think that, you know, CS229 has for many years been the core of the machine learning world at Stanford. Uh, but even beyond CS229 is worth your while to take multiple classes and gain multiple perspectives. So, so if you want to, uh, be really effective, you know, after you've dragged from Stanford, you do want to be an expert in machine learning. You do want to be an expert in deep learning. Uh, and you probably want to know problem statistics, maybe you want to know a bit of complex optimization, maybe you want to know a bit more about reinforcement learning, know a little bit about planning, know a bit about loss of things. So, so I, I, I actually encourage you to, to take multiple classes, I guess. Cool. All right, good. Um, if there are no more questions, let's go on to talk a bit about, um, machine learning. Okay. So, um, all right. So in the remainder of this class, what I'd like to do is, um, give a quick overview of, uh, you know, the major, uh, uh, areas of machine learning and also, um, and- and- and also give you a sort of overview of the things you learn, uh, in the next 10 weeks. So, you know, what- what is machine learning, right? It seems to be everywhere these days and it's useful for so many places and- and I think that, um, uh, and- and- and you know, and- and, uh, uh, and I- I feel like, uh, by the way, just to share with you my personal bias, right? you read the news about these people making so much money building learning algorithms. I think that's great. I hope all of you go make a lot of money. But the thing I find even more exciting is, is the meaningful work we could do. Right? I think that, you know, I think that every time there's a major technological disruption, which there is now through machine learning, um, it gives us an opportunity to remake large parts of the world. And if we behave ethically in a principal way and use these superpowers of machine learning to do things that, you know, helps people's lives, right? Maybe we could, um, uh, maybe you can improve the healthcare system. Maybe you can improve, give every child a personalized tutor. Uh, maybe you can make a democracy run better rather than make it run worse. But I think that, um, the meaning I find in machine learning is that there's so many people that are so eager for us to go in and help them with these tools that, um, if, if, if you become good at these tools, it gives you an opportunity to really remake some piece, some meaningful piece of the world, hopefully in a way that helps other people and makes the world, kind of makes the world a better place is very cliche and it's like a valley. But, but I think, you know, with these tools you actually have the power to do that. And if you go make a ton of money, that's great too. But I find that much greater meaning in the work we could do. It gives us a unique opportunity to do these things. But despite all the excitement of machine learning, what is machine learning? So let me give you a couple definitions of machine learning. Um, Arthur Samuel, who's claimed to fame was, uh, building a checkers playing program, uh, defined it as follows. So field study gives computer ability to learn what being supposed to be programmed. Um, and, uh, you know, interesting. When, when Arthur Samuel many, many decades ago wrote a checkers playing program, uh, the debate of the day was, can a computer ever do something that it wasn't explicitly told to do? And Arthur Samuel wrote a checkers playing program that through self-play, learned whether the patterns of a checkerboard that are more likely to lead to a win versus more likely to lead to a loss and learned to be even better than Arthur Samuel, the author himself at playing checkers. So back then, there was this very remarkable result that a computer programmer, you know, that could write a piece of software to do something that the computer programmer himself could not do, right? Because this program became better at Arthur Samuel, um, at, uh, uh, at, at, at the toss of playing checkers. Um, and I think today we, um, used computers or machine learning algorithms outperforming humans on so many tasks. Uh, uh, but it turns out that when you choose a narrow task, like speech recognition on a certain type of toss. You can maybe surpass human level performance. If you choose a narrow toss like playing the game of Go, then by throwing really tons of conversation power at it and self-play, uh, uh, you can have a computer, you know, become very good at- at these narrow toss. But this was maybe one of the first such examples in history of computing. Um, uh, and I think this is still one of the most widely cited, um, uh, definitions, right? Uh, gives computer disability learning well-being explicitly programs. Um, my friend Tom Mitchell in his textbook, uh, defined this as a well-posed learning problem. Uh, programs said to learn from experience e with respect to toss t on some performance major p if it's performed on t as measured by p improves on experience e. You know, and I- I- I asked Tom this. I asked Tom if, um, he wrote this definition just because he wanted it to rhyme. And then he- he- he- he did not say yes, but I- I- I- I don't know. Um, but in this definition, the experience E, for the case of playing checkers, the experience E would be the experience of having a checklist program play tons of games against itself. Uh, so, you know, computers lost the patience and sit there for days playing games of checkers against itself. So that's the experience E. Uh, the task T is the task of playing checkers. So the performance measure P maybe, um, was the chance of this program winning the next game of checkers it plays against the next opponent, right? So, so we say that, uh, this is a well-posed learning problem, learning of the checkers. Now, within this, um, set of ideas of machine learning, there are many different tools we use in machine learning. And so in the next 10 weeks, you learn about a variety of these different tools. Um, and so the first of them, And the most widely used one is supervised learning. Um, let's see. I want to switch to the whiteboard. Do you guys know how that erase the screen? Oh, like that. Okay. All right, cool. So what I want to do today is really go over some of the major categories of machine learning tools and, and, and, and sort of what you learn in the next, um, uh, by the end of this quarter. So the most widely used machine learning tool is, um, today is supervised learning. Actually, let me check. How, how many of you know what supervised learning is? Uh, like a two-thirds, half of you maybe? Okay, cool. Let me, let me just briefly define it. Um, here's one example. Let's say you have a database of housing prices and so I'm going to plot your dataset where on the horizontal axis, I'm going to plot the size of the house in square feet. You know, and then the vertical axis will plot the price of the house, right? And, um, maybe your dataset looks like that. Um, and so horizontal axis, I guess we'll call this x and vertical axis we'll call that y. So, um, the supervised learning problem is, given the data set like this, define the relationship mapping from x to y. And so, um, for example, let's say you have- let's say, uh, let's say you have a- let's say you're fortunate enough to own a house in Palo Alto, right? Uh, and you're trying to sell it and you want to know how to price the house. So maybe your host has a size, you know, of that amount on the horizontal axis. I don't know. This is a, what, 500 square feet, 1000 square feet, 1500 square feet. So your host is 1250 square feet, right? And you want to know, you know, how do you price this house? So given this data set, one thing you can do is fit a straight line to it, right? And then you could estimate or predict the price to be whatever value you read off on the, um, vertical axis. So in supervised learning, you are given a dataset with, uh, in POS-X and labels Y, and your goal is to learn a mapping from X to Y, right? Now, um, filling a straight line to data is maybe the simplest possible, maybe the simplest possible learning algorithm, maybe one of the simplest learning algorithms, um, Given the data set like there's many possible ways to learn the mapping, to learn the function mapping from the input size to the estimated price. And so, um, maybe you want to fit a quadratic function instead. Maybe that actually fits the data a little bit better. And so how do you choose among different models will be, uh, either automatically or manual intervention will be, will be something we'll spend a lot of time talking about. Now, to give a little bit more, um, to define a few more things, This particular example is a problem called a regression problem. And determined regression refers to that the, uh, value while you're trying to predict is continuous, right? Um, in contrast, here is a- here's a different type of problem. Um, so a problem that some of my friends were working on, and I'll simplify it, was- was a healthcare problem where, uh, they were looking at, uh, breast cancer, uh, breast tumors, Um, and trying to decide if a tumor is benign or malignant, right? So a tumor, you know, sort of a lump in a- in a woman's breast, um, is, uh, uh, can be malign or cancerous, um, or benign, meaning, you know, roughly there's not that harmful. And so if on the horizontal axis, you plot the size of a tumor, um, and on the vertical axis, you plot is it malignant or not? So malignant means harmful, right? Um, and some tumors are harmful, some are not. And so whether it's malignant or not takes only two values, one or zero. And so you may have a dataset, um, like that, right? Uh, and given this, can you learn the mapping from x to y? so that if a new patient walks into your office, walks into the doctor's office and the tumor sizes, you know, say this, can the learning algorithm figure out from this data that, you know, it's probably, well, based on this data set, looks like there's a- there's a high chance that that tumor is malignant. So, uh, so this is an example of a classification problem. And the term classification refers to that why here takes on a discrete number of variables. So for regression problem, why is a real number? I guess technically prices can be rounded off to the nearest dollar and cent. So prices aren't really real numbers, you know, because you probably not price of, how's that like pi times 1 million or whatever. But so, but, but, but for all practical purposes prices are continuous. So we call them housing price prediction to be a regression problem. Whereas if you have two values of possible output 0, 1, we call that classification problem. Um, if you have k discrete outputs, so, uh, if the tumor can be, um, malignant or if there are five types of cancer, right? So you have one of five possible outputs, then that's also a classification problem if the output is discrete. Now, um, I want to find a different way to visualize this dataset, which is, um, let me draw a line on top. And I'm just gonna, you know, map all this data on horizontal axis up with onto a line. Um, but, well, let me just show you what I'm going to do. I'm going to use a symbol o to denote, right? Um, I hope what I did was clear. So I took the two sets of examples, the positive and negative examples. Positive examples is 1, negative examples is 0. And I took all of these examples and, and kind of pushed them up onto straight line. And I used two symbols, I used O's to denote negative examples, and I used crosses to denote positive examples. Okay. So this is just a different way of visualizing the same data, um, but drawing it on a line and using, you know, two symbols to denote the two discrete values around 1. Right? So, um, it turns out that, uh, uh, in both of these examples, the input x was one dimensional. It was a single row number. For most of the, um, machine learning applications you work with, the input x will be multi-dimensional. You won't be given just one number and also predict another number. Instead, you often be given, uh, multiple features or multiple numbers to predict another number. So for example, instead of just using, uh, tumor size to predict to estimate malignant C open- malignant versus benign tumors. Um, you may instead have two features where one is tumor size and the second is age of the patient and be given a dataset. Let me listen. Right. And be given a dataset that looks like that, right? Where now your task is given two input features. So x is tumor size and age, you know, like a two dimensional vector. Um, and your toss is given, uh, these two input features, um, to predict whether a given tumor is malignant or benign. So if a new patient walks in the doctor's office and the tumor size is here and the age is here, so that point there, then hopefully you can conclude that, you know, this patient's tumor is probably benign, right? Because one thing is, uh, oh, that's a negative example. Um, and so what thing- one thing you learn, uh, next week is a learning algorithm that can fit a straight line to the data as follows, kind of like that to separate out the positive and negative examples, separate out the O's and the crosses. And so next week you'll learn about the logistic regression algorithm, which, um, which can do that. Okay. So, um, one of the most interesting things you learn about is, uh, let's see. So in this example, I drew this set with two input features. Um, when- so I have friends that actually worked on the breast cancer prediction problem and in practice, you usually have a lot more than one or two features and usually you have so many features you can't put them on the board, right? And so for an actual breast cancer prediction problem, my friends are working on this, we're- we're using many other features such as, don't worry about what these mean, like this clump thickness, Uh, you know, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, right? Um, uh, adhesion, how will the cells stick together? Don't worry about what this means. But, uh, if you're actually doing this in, in an actual medical application, there's a good chance that you'll be using a lot more features than just two. Uh, and this means that you actually can't plot this data, right? It's too high dimensional. you can't plot things higher than three-dimensional, maybe four-dimensional or something, right? And so we have a lot of features that are actually difficult to plot this data. I'll come back to this in a second in learning theory. Um, and, uh, one of the things you learn about, so as we develop learning algorithms, you learn how to build, um, regression algorithms or classification algorithms that can deal with these relatively large number of features. One of the, uh, most fascinating results you learn is that, um, You also learn about an algorithm called support vector machine, which uses not one or two or three or 10 or 100 or a million input features, but uses an infinite number of input features, right? And so, so, so just be clear, if in this example, the state of a patient were represented as one number, you know, tumor size. Uh, in this example, we had two features. So the state of a patient were represented using two numbers, tumor size in the age. If you use this list of features, maybe as patients represent it with five or six numbers. Uh, but there's an algorithm called the support vector machine that allows you to use an infinite dimensional vector, um, to represent a patient. And, um, how do you deal with that and how can a computer even store an infinite dimensional vector? Right? I mean, you know, computer memory, you can store one real number, two real numbers, but you can't store an infinite number of real numbers in the computer without running out of memory or process speed or whatever. So, so how do you do that? Uh, so when you talk about support vector machines, uh, and specifically the technical method called kernels, you learn how to build learning algorithms that work with, uh, sort of infinitely long list of features, infinitely long list of features, uh, for, for, which, which, and you can imagine that if you have an infinitely long list of numbers to represent a patient, that might give you a lot of information about that patient and so that is one of the relatively effective learning algorithms of some problems. Okay. Um, so that's supervised learning. And you know, let me just, um, uh, play a video, um, show you a fun, slightly older example of supervised learning. Give you a sense of what this means. But at the heart of supervised learning is the idea that during training, uh, you are given inputs x together with the labels y and you give it both at the same time. And the job of your learning algorithm is to, uh, find a mapping so that given a new x, you can map it to the most appropriate output y. Um, so this is a very old video, uh, made by, um, uh, Dean Pomelo known for a long time as well on using supervised learning for autonomous driving. This is not state of the art for tolerance driving anymore, but it actually does remarkably well. Oh, and, um, as you, uh, you hear a few technical terms like back propagation, you learn all those techniques in this class, uh, and by the end of the class, you really build a learning algorithm much more effective than what you see here. But let's, let's, let's see this application. Uh, could you turn up the volume if you have that? Are you guys getting volume? Hold here. Oh, I see. All right. I'll narrate this. Uh, so I'll be using artificial neural network to drive this vehicle that, uh, was built at Carnegie Mellon University, uh, many years ago. And what happens is, uh, during training, it watches the human, um, drive the vehicle and I think 10 times a second, uh, it digitizes the image in front of the vehicle. And, um, so that's the picture taken by a front-facing camera. Um, and what it does is in order to collect label data, the car while the human is driving it, records both the image such as you're seeing here, as well as the steering direction that was chosen by a human. So at the bottom here is the image turned to the grayscale and lower res. And, uh, on top, let me pause this for a second. Um, this is the driver direction. The font's kind of blurry, but this text says driver direction. So this is the Y label, the label Y that the human driver chose. Um, and so the position of this white bar of this white blob shows how the human is choosing to steer the car. So in this- in this image, the white blob is a little bit to the left of center. So the human is steering just a little bit to the left. Um, this second line here is the output of the neural network. And initially, the neural network doesn't know how to drive. And so it's just outputting this white smear everywhere. Just saying, you know, I don't know, did I drive left, right, center? I don't know. So it's gonna outputting this gray blur everywhere. Um, and as the algorithm learns using the back propagation learning algorithm or gradient descent, which you learn about, uh, you actually learn about gradient descent this Wednesday. Um, you see that the neural network's outputs becomes less and less of this white smear, this white blur, but starts to become sharper, um, and starts to mimic more accurately the human selected driving direction. Right? So this, um, is an example of supervised learning because the human driver demonstrates inputs x and outputs y. Uh, namely, if you see this in front of the car, steer like that, so that's x and y. And, uh, after the learning algorithm has learned, um, you can then, uh, well, he pushes a button, takes a hand off the steering wheel, um, and then is using this neural network to drive itself, right? Digitizing the image in front of the road, taking this image and passing it through the learning algorithm through the train neural network, letting the neural network select the steering direction, uh, and then using a little motor to turn the wheel. Um, there's a slightly more advanced version which has trained two separate models, one for, I think a two-lane road, one for a four-lane road, uh, so that's the, um, uh, so the second and third lines. This is for a two-lane road, this is a four-lane road and the arbitrator is, is another algorithm that tries to decide whether the two-lane or the four-lane road model is a more, more appropriate one for a particular given situation. Um, and so as Alvin is drawing, excuse me, a one-lane road or a two-lane road. So it says driving from a one-lane road here, uh, toward an intersection. The algorithm realizes it should switch over from, I think, I forget, I think the one-lay neural network to the two-lay neural network, one of these, right? Okay. Oh, all right, fine. We just see the final dramatic moment that's switching from a one-day road to a two-day road. All right. Um, uh, and I think, you know, so this is just using Sufi's learning to take is input what's in front of your car to decide on steering direction. This is not said the art for how self-driving cars are built today, but you know, it could do some things in some limited contexts. Uh, and I think, uh, in- in- in several weeks you actually be able to build something that is more sophisticated than this. Right. Um, so after supervised learning, uh, we w- well, in this class we'll spend a bit of time talking about machine learning strategy or something. I think on the class notes we annotate this as a learning theory. But what that means is, um, I want to give you the tools to go out and apply learning algorithms effectively. And I think I've been fortunate to have, uh, you know, to know a lot of, uh, uh, I- I think that, um, I've been fortunate to have, you know, over the years constantly visited lots of great tech companies, uh, uh, more than ones that I've- that- that I've been publicly associated with, right? But often, just to help friends out, I visit various tech companies, uh, of the sort whose products I'm sure are installed on your cell phone. Uh, but I often visit tech companies and, you know, talk to the machine learning teams and see what they're doing and see if I can help them out. And what I see is that there's a huge difference in the effectiveness of how two different teams could apply the exact same learning algorithm, right? And I think that what I've seen sadly is that sometimes there will be a team, even in some of the best tech companies, right, the elite AI companies, right, in multiple of them, where you go talk to a team and they'll tell you about something they've been working on for six months. And then you can quickly take a look at the data and hear that they're not, their room isn't quite working and sometimes you could look at what they're doing and go, Yeah, you know, I could have told you six months ago that this approach is never gonna work, right? Um, and, um, what I find is that the most skilled machine learning practitioners are very strategic, by which I mean that your skill at deciding, um, when you work on machine learning project, you all- you- you have a lot of decisions to make, right? Do you collect more data? Do you try a different learning algorithm? Uh, do you rent faster GPUs to train your learning algorithm for longer? Oh, if you collect more data, what type of data do you collect? or for all of these architecture choices using neural networks, what vector machine, the distribution, which one do you pick? Um, but there are a lot of decisions you need to make when building these learning algorithms. So one thing that's quite unique to the way we teach is, uh, we want to help you become more systematic in driving machine learning as, uh, as a systematic engineering discipline so that when one day you're working on machine learning project, you can efficiently figure out what to do next. Right. Um, and I sometimes make an analogy to how, um, to, uh, uh, to, to, to, to software engineering. Um, you know, I, many years ago, I had a friend, um, that would debug code by compiling it. And then, um, uh, this friend would look all these syntax errors, right? That, you know, C plus is compiler outputs. And they thought that the best way to eliminate the errors is to delete all the lines of code were syntax errors and those are first-serious. So that did not go well, right? Um, uh, took me a while to persuade them to stop doing that. But, but, but, so it turns out that, um, when you run a learning algorithm, you know, it almost never works the first time, right? It's just like, uh, uh, and, and, and the way you go about debugging the learning algorithm, you have a huge impact on your efficiency on, on how quickly you can build effective learning systems. And I think until now, too much of the- of this process of, uh, making your learning algorithms work well has been a black magic kind of process, where, you know, has worked on this for decades. So when you run something and don't know why it's not working, you're like, hey, what do I do? And I said, oh yeah, I do that. And then, and then because he's so experienced it works. But I think, um, what we're trying to do with the discipline machine learning is to evolve it from a black magic tribal knowledge experience-based thing to a systematic engineering process, right? And so, um, later this quarter, as we talk about machine learning strategy or talk about learning theory, you try to systematically give you tools on how to, um, go about strategizing, uh, so- so it can be very efficient in, um, how you- how you yourself or how you can lead a team to build an effective learning system. Because I- I don't want you to be one of those people that, you know, wait six months on some direction that maybe could that relatively quickly figured out was not promising. Well, maybe one last analogy. If you- if you're used to optimizing code, right? Making code run faster, not sure how many of you have done that. Uh, uh, less experienced software engineers will just dive in and optimize the code to try to make it run faster, right? Let's take the C++ and code an assembly or something. But more experienced people will run a profiler to try to figure out what part of your code is actually a bottleneck and then just focus on changing on that. So, uh, one of the things hoped to do this quarter is, uh, uh, convey to you some of these more systematic engineering principles, right? And, yeah, oh, and actually if anybody understands this, this is, uh, uh, uh, yeah, actually I've been, um, I've been, I've been writing, so actually, so, uh, how many of you have heard of machine learning and yearning? Oh, just a few of you, interesting. So, actually, to, to, if anybody are interested, um, just in my, uh, spare time. Uh, I've been writing a book, um, uh, to try to codify systematic engineering principles for machine learning. And so if you, uh, uh, and so, uh, if you want to, you know, free draft copy of the book, sign up for a mailing list here. I tend to just write stuff and put it on the internet for free, right? So if you want to free draft copy of the book, uh, uh, uh, you know, go to this website, uh, enter your email address, and the website will send you a copy of the book. They'll talk a little bit about these engineering principles as well. Okay. All right. So, uh, so first subject, machine learning, second subject, learning theory. Um, and, uh, the third major subject we'll talk about is, uh, deep learning, right? And so, you know, there are a lot of tools in machine learning and many of them are worth learning about. And I use many different tools in machine learning, you know, for many different applications. There's one subset of machine learning that's really hot right now because it's just advancing very rapidly, which is deep learning. And so we'll spend a bit of time talking about deep learning so that you can understand the basics of how to train a neural network as well, right? But I think that, um, whereas 2, 3, 9 covers a much broader set of algorithms which are all useful, CS230 more narrowly covers just deep learning, right? So, uh, other than deep learning slash, After- after deep learning session neural networks, the other- the- the fourth of the five major topics we cover will be unsupervised learning. Um, so what is unsupervised learning? So you saw me draw a picture like this just now, right? And this would be a classification problem, like the, uh, tumor malignant benign problem, this is a classification problem. And that was a supervised learning problem because you have to learn a function mapping from x to y. Um, unsupervised learning would be if I give you a data set like this with no labels. So you just give in inputs x and no y, and you're asked to find me something interesting in this data, figure out, you know, interesting structure in this data. Um, and so in this data set, it looks like there are two clusters and then unsupervised learning algorithm, which you learn about called K-means clustering, would discover this, um, this structure in the data. Um, other examples unsupervised learning, you know, if, if you- actually Google News is a, is a very interesting website. Sometimes I use it to look up, right, latest news. This is an old example. But Google News every day, uh, crawls or reads, uh, uh, I don't know, uh, uh, many, many thousands or tens of thousands of news articles on the internet and groups them together. Right? For example, there's a set of articles on the BP All Well Spill, and it has taken a lot of the articles written by different reporters and grouped them together. So you can figure out that BP, Mekondo, All Well, right? That this is a CNN article about the All Well Spill, this is a Guardian article about All Well Spill, and this is an example of a clustering algorithm, whereas, uh, taking these different new sources and figuring out that these are all stories, kind of about the same thing, right? Um, and other examples of clustering, just getting data and figuring out what groups belong together. Um, lot of work on, um, genetic data. This is a visualization of, uh, uh, genetic microarray data where given data like this, you can group individuals into different types of, into individuals of different characteristics. Or clustering algorithms, grouping the several data together is used to organize computing clusters, you know, figure out what machines workloads are more related to each other, and organize community clusters appropriately. So take a social network like, you know, LinkedIn or Facebook or other social networks, and figure out which are the groups of friends, so which are the cohesive communities within a social network. Or market segmentation. Actually, many companies I've worked with look at the customer database and cluster the users together. So you can say that looks like we're four types of users. Looks like that there are the young professionals looking to develop themselves. There are the soccer moms and soccer dads. There are the discolored and discolored. So you can then market to the different market segments separately. Uh, and, and, and actually many years ago my friend Andrew Moore, uh, uh, was using this type of data for astronomical data analysis, so group together galaxies. Question? So does all of us learn how to do custering? Oh, is all of us learning custering? No, it's not. So unswear- unswear- unswear learning broadly is the concept of using unlabeled data, so just X and finding interesting things about it, right? Um, so, uh, for example, uh, Actually, here's shoot. This won't work without audio. We'll do this later in the class, I guess. Um, maybe I'll see you when I do this later. Coughtail party problem, um, uh, is another unsupervised learning problem. Really need audio for this to explain this though. Um, let me think how to explain this. Uh, your Coughtail party problems, I'll, I'll try to do the demo when we can get audio work on this laptop. is a problem where if you have a noisy room and you stick multiple microphones in the room and record overlapping voices, so there are no labels. We just have multiple microphones, an array of microphones in a room with lots of people talking. How can you have the algorithm separate out the people's voices? So that's an unsupervised learning problem because there are no labels. You just stick microphones in the room and have it record different people's voices, overlapping voices, you have multiple people talking at the same time, and then have it try to separate out people's voices. And one of the primary exercises you do later is if we have, you know, five people talking. So each microphone records five people's overlapping voices, right? Because, you know, each microphone hears five people at the same time. How can you have an algorithm separate out these voices so you get clean recordings of just one voice at a time? So that's called the cocktail party problem. And the algorithm you used to do this is called ICA, Independent Components Analysis. and that's something you implement in one of the latest homework exercises. Um, and there are other examples of unsupervised learning as well. Uh, the Internet has tons of unlabeled text data. You just suck down data from the Internet. Uh, there are no labels, uh, necessarily. But can you learn interesting things about language? Figure out what- figure out, uh, uh, I don't know, one of the best-cited results recently was learning analogies. Like, you know, man is the woman, as King of the Queen, right? Or what Tokyo is to Japan as Washington DC is to the United States, right? To learn analogies like that. Turns out you can learn analogies like that from unlabeled data just from text on the Internet. So that's also unsupervised learning. Okay. So after unsupervised learning, oh, and unsupervised learning. So, you know, machine learning is very useful today. Turns out that most of the recent wave of economic value created by machine learning is through supervised learning. Uh, but there are important use cases for unsupervised learning as well. So I use them in my work occasionally. Uh, uh, and there's also a beating edge for a lot of exciting research. And then the final topic, final of the five topics we cover. So talk about supervised learning, um, machine learning strategy, deep learning, unsupervised learning, and then the fifth one is reinforcement learning is this, which is, um, let's say I give you the keys to Stanford-Latana's helicopter. Uh, this helicopter is actually sitting in my office. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it. Um, and, and I asked you to write a program to, to, to make it fly, right? So how do you do that? Um, so this is a video of a helicopter flying. Uh, the audio is just of a lot of helicopter noise, so that's not important. But, uh, we'll zoom out the video, you see trees flying in the sky, right? But so, um, you can use learning algorithms. Yeah, that's kinda cool, right? I- I was the- I was the cameraman that day. Um, but so you can use learning algorithms to get, you know, robots to do pretty interesting things like this. Um, and it turns out that a good way to do this is through reinforcement learning. So- so what's reinforcement learning? Um, it turns out that no one knows what's the optimal way to fly a helicopter, right? If you fly a helicopter, you have two control sticks that you're moving. Um, but no one knows what's the optimal way to move the control state. So the way you can get a helicopter to fly itself is, um, let the helicopter do whatever. Think of it as training a dog, right? Like how- you can't teach a dog the optimal way to behave. But actually, how- how many of you have had a pet dog or pet cat before? Huh, not that many of you. That's fascinating. Okay. So I had a pet dog when I was a kid, and my family made it my job to train the dog. So how do you train the dog? You let the dog do whatever it wants, And then whenever it behaves well, you go, oh, good dog. And when it misbehaves, you go bad dog. Um, and then over time, the dog learns to do more of the good dog things and fear of the bad dog things. And so reinforcement learning is a bit like that, right? I don't know what's the awful way to fly a helicopter. So you let the helicopter do whatever it wants, and then whenever it flies well, you know, does some maneuver you want or flies accurately without jittering around too much, you go, oh, good helicopter. And- and when it crashes, you go bad helicopter. And it's the job of the reinforcement learning algorithms to figure out how to control it over time so as to get more of the good helicopter things and feel the bad helicopter things. Um, and I think, um, well, just one more video. Um, oh, interesting. Yeah. All right. And so, again, given a robot like this, I- I actually don't know how to program a- I- I actually, You know, robot like this has a lot of joints, right? So how do you get a robot like this to climb more obstacles? So, well, this is actually a robot dog. So you can actually say good dog or bad dog. Um, but by giving those signals called a reward signal, uh, you can have a learning algorithm figure out by itself how to optimize the reward. And therefore, climb over these types of obstacles. Um, and I think recently the most famous applications of reinforcement learning have been for game playing, playing Atari games or playing game of Go, like in AlphaGo. I think that game playing has made for some remarkable stunts, a remarkable PR, but I'm also equally excited or maybe even more excited about the in-roads that reinforcement learning is making into robotics applications. So I think reinforcement has been proven to be fantastic for playing games, is also getting- making row traction in, um, optimizing robots and optimizing, sort of, uh, the logistics system and things like that. Um, so you learn about all these things. Um, last thing for today, uh, I hope that you will start to, uh, talk- meet people in the class, make friends, form project partners and study groups. Uh, and if you have any questions, you know, dive on the p-outs or ask your questions, let's help others answer their questions. So let's break for today and look forward to seeing you on Wednesday.

Or your phone gallery group's images based on their location? All of this is a product of deep learning. But what exactly is deep learning? Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which in turn is a subset of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a technique that enables a machine to mimic human behavior. Machine learning is a technique to achieve AI through algorithms trained with data. And finally, deep learning is a type of machine learning inspired by the structure of the human brain. In terms of deep learning, this structure is called an artificial neural network. Let's understand deep learning better and how it's different from machine learning. Say we create a machine that could differentiate between tomatoes and cherries. If done using machine learning, we'd have to tell the machine the features based on which the two can be differentiated. These features could be the size and the type of stem on them. With deep learning on the other hand, the features are picked out by the neural network without human intervention. Of course, that kind of independence comes at the cost of having a much higher volume of data to train our machine. Now, let's dive into the working of neural networks. Here, we have three students. Each of them write down the digit 9 on a piece of paper. Notably, they don't all write it identically. The human brain can easily recognize the digits. But what if a computer had to recognize them? That's where deep learning comes in. Here's a neural network trained to identify handwritten digits. Each number is present as an image of 28 x 28 pixels. Now, that amounts to a total of 784 pixels. Neurons, the core entity of a neural network, is where the information processing takes place. Each of the 784 pixels is fed to a neuron in the first layer of our neural network. This forms the input layer. On the other end, we have the output layer with each neuron representing a digit with the hidden layers existing between them. The information is transferred from one layer to another over connecting channels. Each of these has a value attached to it, and hence is called a weighted channel. All neurons have a unique number associated with it called bias. This bias is added to the weighted sum of inputs reaching the neuron, which is then applied to a function known as the activation function. The result of the activation function determines if the neuron gets activated. Every activated neuron passes on information to the following layers. This continues up till the second-last layer. The one neuron activated in the output layer corresponds to the input digit. The weights and bias are continuously adjusted to produce a well-trained network. So where is deep learning applied? Even customer support. When most people converse with customer support agents, the conversation seems so real. They don't even realize that it's actually a bot on the other side. In medical care, neural networks detect cancer cells and analyze MRI images to give detailed results. Self-Driving Cars What seemed like science fiction is now a reality. Apple, Tesla, and Nissan are only a few of the companies working on self-driving cars, So deep learning has a vast scope, but it too faces some limitations. The first as we discussed earlier is data. While deep learning is the most efficient way to deal with unstructured data, a neural network requires a massive volume of data to train. Let's assume we always have access to the necessary amount of data. Processing this is not within the capability of every machine. And that brings us to our second limitation, computational power. Training a neural network requires graphical processing units, which have thousands of cores as compared to CPUs. And GPUs are of course more expensive. And finally, we come down to training time. Deep neural networks take hours or even months to train. The time increases with the amount of data and number of layers in the network. So here's a short quiz for you. Arrange the following statements in order to describe the working of a neural network. A. The bias is added. B. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated. C. Specific neuron is activated. D. The result is fed to an activation function. Leave your answers in the comments section below. Three of you stand a chance to win Amazon vouchers.

He is interested in hosting an online store for home decor products like bases, curtains, artwork, and home furnishings. He requires a software application that would allow the customers to browse the available products at their fingertips and buy them online. Adam, eager to jump into his new business, wanted to understand how the software development process works. To start with his business idea, Adam meets his cousin, Mark, who is a software developer and a good one at it. He pitches his idea and asks his cousin to help him design an online business application. Mark explains to Adam the way of designing the best online shopping application. We need to understand the working of the software development lifecycle, also known as the SDLC. It involves distinctive phases to initiate the software production based on the client requirements. Further, Mark briefs Adam about the six crucial phases of SDLC in designing any software application. Planning requirements phase, requirement analysis phase, designing phase, implementation phase, testing phase, deployment and maintenance phase. The development team will commence production post-agreing on the terms and conditions discussed between the client and the development team regarding all the proceedings and requirements. Initiating the production with the planning requirements phase, where the client and the development team will discuss the basic requirements for the software, like like the purpose of the application, the details about the end user of the product, key elements like format and attributes of the application for designing, and the overall user interface's design of the software. The development moves on to the second stage, the requirement analysis phase, which includes the detailed information about each element to design the software as discussed, validating the installation of elements in the application according to the client's requirements, Calibrating the security protocols and performing risk analysis for the software application, all the discussed details are then to be filed in the Software Requirements Specification document, also known as the SRS document. After completing the second phase, third stage of software development, the Design phase, the software designers will devise the system design following the SRS document. The system design defines the overall architecture of the software and checks its feasibility with the client's requirements. All the details of the design phase are added to the design document specification, also known as the DDS document, and shared with the analysts and stakeholders for review. Next, the development moves on to the fourth stage, the coding or implementation phase. In the coding phase, the developers start writing the code using the languages they choose for the software development. The coding stage is also one of the most important phases as it encapsulates the implementation of the software product. The developers use predefined guidelines and development tools like compilers and debuggers to implement the code. The next phase of the production is where we begin with the fifth stage of software development, the testing phase. The developed software is now deployed in multiple test environments to check the functioning of all the attributes in the software architecture. After the test cases are completed, the quality assurance and the testing team may find errors or bugs in the software, which will be forwarded to the developer team for debugging. This testing and debugging process continues until the software is stable and works per the required specifications. As for the last stage in the SDLC lifecycle, the deployment and maintenance phase is initiated. With the testing phase completed, the software application is ready for deployment and consumer use. In this phase, the development team will set up links for the application and make it accessible to the users. After the deployment is completed and users begin using the application, they may encounter an error or a bug in the application, which is to be solved from time to time. Maintenance also includes releasing application updates and enhancements for the software for better performance and user experience. At this point, Adam was surprised by all the effort and steps taken by the development team to design a software application and the key phases involved in SDLC. And on that note, here's a question for you all. What does the design document specification document include? include software code, details on defects and bugs, software architecture details, software requirements. Give it a thought and leave your answers in the comments section below. Three lucky winners will receive Amazon gift vouchers. With Mark's explanation of the SDLC lifecycle, Adam understood how software is developed. Now he can actively give feedback to the development team and design the best software application for his online store and maybe expand to other businesses as well.

{"video_id": "ZAqIoDhornk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAqIoDhornk", "title": "ALL OF PHYSICS explained in 14 Minutes", "domain": "engineering", "duration": 860, "transcript": "Hi, you're on a rock floating in space, surrounded by more rocks, and gas, and a bunch of nothing, mainly. Oh hey, look at that, the rocks are going around the gas. Hold on, what the heck is going on here? To understand, let's look at a little bit of physics. Wait, did I say a little bit? To find out what kind of magic this is, we'll have to go back in time. Okay, not that far. Stop. Yeah, that's perfect. This is Gravity Guy, but most people call him Isaac Newton. One important thing he said is that force equals mass times acceleration. Now what do all these words even mean? Force is a push or pull on something in a certain direction. Mass tells you how much of something there is and it's also a measure of inertia but we'll get to that later. And acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, but that's too many big words for my taste so let's just say it's how fast your velocity is changing. The key takeaway is that if you apply force to a fixed mass you get a predictable amount of acceleration. If you know all the forces acting on a basketball midair you can predict with 100% certainty if the ball will go in the hoop or your neighbor's windshield. Whoa! Did an apple just fall on my head? Yes, Newton, it did. Yep, that must have happened for a reason, said Newton, as he discovered that two masses attract one another, making the apple fall. Yes, even you, no matter how ugly you think you are, attract pretty much the whole universe at least a little bit. Hey, can you put that on paper? Yup, said Newton, who gave us the law of universal gravitation. In other words, how much do bodies pull on each other given their mass and distance times a constant. Bigger mass, bigger pole. Bigger distance, smaller pole. Actually, a lot smaller pole. You see, as the distance increases, the force gets smaller by the square. That, my friends, is the inverse square law. Gravity is also the reason why planets in our solar system orbit the sun. They got their initial velocity when the solar system formed out of spinning gas, and since there's nothing in space to stop them from moving, they'll keep moving. Hey, that's Newton's first law. The sun is so massive that the force of gravity keeps pulling the planets towards the sun, but the planets are fast enough to essentially fall towards the sun but miss it, and this goes on forever creating a round orbit. Actually that's kind of a lie, most orbits are not perfectly round but more egg shaped, and Pluto's orbit is just a complete mess, but you get the idea. In this case, the gravity is what we call a centripetal force. One thing many people confuse is mass and weight, and no, they're not the same. Mass tells you how much of this blob there is, and weight is the force of gravity the blob would feel. To make things clear, your mass would be the same on the earth and on the moon, but the weight you would perceive is different because the moon has a weaker gravitational pull, meaning a weaker force acting on your mass. So really, you're not overweight, you're just on the wrong planet. Alright, enough about Newton, let's break some stuff. If you ever dropped your phone, it might look like this. What the hell ground, why'd you do that? The answer is energy. You know, the thing kids have after eating gummy bears. Energy has the unit jewel, and it's not like force, it doesn't have a direction, It's just a number that's kinda chillin' there, as a property of a thing. You see, there's two main kinds of energy. Kinetic energy and potential energy. In plain English, energy of movement and stored energy due to some circumstance. For example, when you held your phone, it stored gravitational potential energy due to being held above the ground at a certain height. Once you dropped it, that potential energy was converted into kinetic energy as the phone fell. Then it smashed into the ground, and the phone absorbed some of the energy making the screen go BOOM! Work is defined as force applied over distance. For example, if you lift an apple by one meter, you would have done about one joule of work. This happened by converting chemical energy stored in your body to gravitational potential energy stored in the apple. As you may have noticed, energy and work have the same unit joule. So they must be the same thing? No, energy is the total amount of work that a thing could possibly do, and work is just the stuff that actually happened and required energy. If you try to lift a weight that's too heavy for you, you'd feel like that took a bunch of work, right? Well, yes, but your feelings are invalid in the face of physics. Mathematically, no work has been done, because work is force applied over distance, and since you didn't move the weight at all, no distance means no work. The key thing to remember about energy is that it cannot be created or destroyed, only converted, aka the conservation of energy. Okay, but a car that's moving has kinetic energy. When the car stops, assuming the car doesn't smash into a wall, where does that energy go? When you apply the brakes, there's friction between the brakes and the wheels causing the car to slow down, and creating heat as a byproduct. That heat is then dissipated into the surrounding air, and that makes the molecules in the air move faster. Things that move have kinetic energy, so ultimately the kinetic energy is transferred from the car to the air. With this knowledge we can define that temperature is just the average kinetic energy of atoms in a system. You see, all atoms, not just molecules in the air, wiggle. Like this. The faster they move, the hotter things get. That is temperature. All that talk about hot stuff, I think it's time we talk about thermodynamics. It tells us that jumping in lava is probably a bad idea, but more importantly, the absolute mess that is entropy. Literally, it tells you how much disorder there is in a system, indicating the number of possible states a system could be in. For example, get an ice cube, no not that one, yeah that's perfect, and put it in the sun. The sun will obliterate the ice cube and turn it into water. Looking at the structure of ice and water, we can see that ice is more neatly organized than water, which just kind of goes all over the place. Also, the water could look like this, or this, or even this, but the ice will always look a little something like this. In total, the system went from low entropy to high entropy, meaning more disorder and more possible microstates. This trend applies to everything. The whole universe is on an unstoppable path to higher entropy. It's also the reason why time seems to only go forwards. Practically, entropy tells us that some forms of energy are more useful for doing work than others. Burn some gasoline and your car will move, spitting out heat and gas. heat and gas is pretty much gasoline, just in the form of higher entropy. And as you can imagine, this stuff won't really make your car move, and the gas won't spontaneously turn back into liquid gasoline. Meaning the form of gasoline with lower entropy is more useful for doing work. Okay, but if you put some water in the freezer, will it not decrease in entropy? Yes, but the fridge is not an isolated system and will heat up the room more than it will cool down the water, increasing the total entropy. Want to see some magic? Whoa, what just happened? Some electrons apparently move through some wires and let there be light. What is going on here? Objects have a fancy something called a charge. It can be positive or negative, or if you have the same amount of both, an object is neutral. Electrons have a single negative charge. The flow of electrons is called electric current. To describe it, we use three parameters, current, voltage, and resistance. Current is the amount of electrons passing through a wire in a given amount of time. Voltage is what pushes the electrons to move, but simply put, it's a difference in electric potential so you can imagine it as a slope that goes from high potential to low potential, where the flow of current goes downhill, and resistance is pretty self-explanatory. This is Coulomb's law. Wait a minute, this is just Newton's law of gravitation in disguise. This tells us that electric charges attract each other in a similar way masses do. Opposites want to cuddle, while light charges literally couldn't think of a more disgusting thing than to be with one another. These four equations explain pretty much all of electromagnetism, but don't be scared just because they look scary. I mean, yeah, they do, but it's simpler than it seems at first. The first one states that if there is an electric charge, there will be an electric field or this big E emerging from it. Add another and you have an electrostatic field. These lines tell us in which direction a charged particle would feel a force at any given point. The second one tells us the same for magnetic fields, and even though electric charges are cool and can be alone, magnetic poles are not. They're very lonely, and there will always be a north pole together with a south pole, and a single pole can never be alone. Okay, now here's where things get kinda freaky. You know how electric charges only act on other charges and magnets only affect other magnets? Well, that's only true if they're not moving. The third and fourth Maxwell equations tells us that a moving magnet creates an electric field and a moving charge or electric field creates a magnetic field. One consequence of this is that current can seemingly come out of nowhere by moving a magnet next to a conductor. The moving magnet creates an electric field which makes the electrons inside the conductor go crazy. That is called induction. In other words, electric and magnetic fields are so tightly linked that they are two parts of the same bigger thing. Let's say we have a charge. Since it doesn't move, it has a static electric field. If we accelerate the charge, there will be a magnetic field around it. That magnetic field interacts with the electric field, which again changes the magnetic field and this is a sort of chain reaction that makes the electromagnetic field radiate outwards into space as an electromagnetic wave. Depending on the frequency, the human eye can actually see this. It's called light. But most of the spectrum is invisible to the human eye and is used for things such as Bluetooth, wireless charging, and confusing human apes into thinking magic is real. Hey, can we go back to the water and look at those molecules? Yeah, those, what are they made of? The molecules are made of atoms. Atoms are made of a core and some electrons. The core is made of protons and neutrons, both of which are made of quarks. They're strange yet charming from up top down to the bottom. Oh yeah, there's some more stuff, like for example the overweight brothers of the electron. All of this together makes up the standard model, which we believe to be the smallest things in the universe. At least that's the excuse we have for not knowing what corgs are made of. Fun fact, depending on the number of protons in the core you get different elements. Depending on the number of neutrons in the core you get different isotopes of the same element. Most of which are a little overweight and very unstable, so they fall apart into smaller atoms. That releases ionizing radiation. Not so fun fact, that stuff will kill you. If you have a large group of atoms you can predict when half of those will have fallen apart. That's the half life. Depending on how unstable an isotope is, it will survive a certain amount of time. Some don't want to live, some really don't want to live, but some will live far longer than you probably will. Oh yeah, did I mention that light is like the fastest thing in the universe? To be exact, 299,792,458 meters per second in a vacuum. That is pretty fast, said everyone. Also, light is a wave, said everyone. Why? If you shoot it through two teeny tiny slits, it creates a fancy pattern due to interference, which is just a wave thing. You see when two waves cross, they can add up or cancel each other out. These gaps are the spots where they cancel each other out. So in this case, light behaves like a wave. Ah, screw that! Everything you know is wrong! said Albert Einstein, probably smoking crack after hearing about the photoelectric effect and discovering that light comes in tiny packets called photons. I sure hope that doesn't unravel a whole new area of physics! Anyway he said, as he continued to casually drop an absolute bomb on the entire field of physics with his theory of relativity. He assumed the speed of light is constant because it arises from two other constants. He also assumed the laws of physics are the same for everyone, regardless if moving or at rest. Now think about it, if two people turn on a flashlight but one person is standing still while the other person is on a moving train, wouldn't the person standing still see the other person's light as going faster than the speed of light? The reality is, no, it would be the same as their own flashlight. That's impossible, except if time passes slower for that person from the perspective of this person. In other words, if the speed of light is constant, time must be relative. Also gravity is not actually a force, sorry Newton, but rather a consequence of masses bending spacetime. Einstein thought the universe is a mesh of space and time, and anything with a mass bends this fabric. Also, all objects move freely on a straight line when moving through space. Gravitation is simply the result of objects following these bent lines which appear straight to them. If you have a hard time understanding this, you can imagine two people on earth walking in parallel straight lines. Now imagine one standing on the east coast and one on the west coast of the US. If they both walk north, eventually they'll meet at the north pole. Because of the curvature of the earth, they ended up at the same point even though they both walked straight relative to themselves. Oh yeah, by the way, energy and mass are kinda the same thing he added, which explains why atom bombs are so freaking powerful. According to this formula, even just tiny atoms can release a humongous amount of energy by giving up just a fraction of their mass during fission. What is fission? It's the same thing Oppenheimer used to make this thing go boom. You see, there's two main ways to gain energy from changing nuclei, fission and fusion. Fission aims to split the nucleus of an atom into two or more smaller nuclei, which is most often achieved by blasting the core with neutrons. Fusion is the opposite, where you combine two smaller nuclei to get one bigger one. The energy came from something we call a mass defect, where the resulting nucleus is lighter than the starting nuclei. This missing mass is what was converted to energy during fusion. Fission and fusion are cool, but you gotta be careful or you might just blow up the planet. That totally didn't almost happen before. Multiple times. Heh. He remembered when Einstein said light is a particle, he accidentally discovered a whole new field of physics which he thought is just a giant hoax. Quantum mechanics. This stuff is crazy. Another German guy called Max Planck said, yes, Einstein, you're right. Light does come in tiny packets. Actually all energy comes in tiny packets. Or quanta. Want to know where an electron is inside an atom? It's here. And there, and everywhere at the same time actually, that's a superposition. It's not in one state, it's in multiple states at once. at least until you measure it. Then it chooses one cozy spot to be in. Schrodinger gave us an equation that gives you a probabilistic model of where you can find it if you were to measure. You can imagine this as a cloud and the denser it is, the more likely it is for an electron to be there. But still, where exactly it will end up once you measure it is random. Speaking of observing particles, they're also super sensitive about their private data. Look at these two images of a flying ball. In one, you can clearly see where the ball is, but not in which direction it's moving. And in the other, you can see where it's moving moving in approximately how fast, but not where exactly it is at the moment. That is essentially Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. You can never know both the exact position and the exact speed of a quantum particle at the same time. Okay, let's recap. A small thing can be a particle in a wave at the same time, and when we try to look at them, weird stuff happens. But you know what? It gets even weirder. Think back to the double slit experiment. We know that a light beam acts as a bunch of waves and we get interference. But here's the weird thing. Even if you send individual photons after sending enough of them and detecting where they end up, you get interference. Like, how can that be? What did a single particle interfere with? Well, we think it interfered with itself, because it acted as a wave and went through both slits at the same time. That's a superposition. Okay, well let's just measure which slit it goes through. Uh, yeah, that's not gonna happen. Once you start measuring which slit the photon goes through, it stops acting like a wave and the deference pattern disappears, as every particle chooses just one of the slits to go through. Sounds kinda suspicious to me. Anyways, all this knowledge is gonna cost you one subscribe and a thumbs up. Thank you very much and you can decide if maybe you'd want to tip with a comment perhaps.", "transcript_length": 3184, "reference_summary": "In this engaging explanation of gravity and physics, the author introduces readers to fundamental concepts through a playful narrative. The discussion begins with the observation of celestial bodies, leading to the introduction of Isaac Newton, affectionately dubbed \"Gravity Guy.\" Newton's pivotal equation, force equals mass times acceleration, is simplified to explain how forces act on objects. The narrative highlights the law of universal gravitation, emphasizing that all masses attract each other, with the strength of this attraction influenced by their mass and distance\u2014illustrated by the inverse square law.\n\nThe text further explains how gravity governs the orbits of planets around the sun, where their initial velocity allows them to \"fall\" towards the sun without colliding, creating elliptical orbits. A distinction between mass and weight is made, clarifying that while mass remains constant, weight varies with gravitational pull. The author also touches on energy types, defining kinetic energy as the energy of movement and potential energy as stored energy, exemplified by a dropped phone transitioning from potential to kinetic energy upon impact. Overall, the summary encapsulates key physics principles while maintaining an engaging tone.", "channel": "Wacky Science"}

This is the Pesa canoe, a 10-foot long canoe that was found in the Netherlands and it is the oldest known boat dating back to roughly 8,000 BC and despite what it looks like it survived longer than the Titanic. Quite impressive, maybe they knew something. But boats have been around for thousands of years. It wouldn't be until 1783 that humans would take to the skies for the first time, and then in 1961 we would leave Earth's atmosphere for the first time, and then in 2016 we finally got Pokemon Go. So let's see all the things that happened in between. After the Pesa canoe over the next several thousand years we got things like irrigation, which transformed agriculture. The wheel wouldn't be invented until about 4,000 BC, originally meant to help with pottery. The pyramids and stone hens were being worked on around the same time, but actually several other megaliths or stone structures were made during these pre-Jesus times, as we found in Turkey, France, Korea, and more. But one of the most famous architectural constructs obviously still used today is that arch. The arch dates back to almost 2000 BC and and it was used extensively by the Romans. And the most famous structure made by the Romans that originally had 240 arches on it is the Colosseum, still to this day the largest amphitheater in the world. The dome, aqueducts, concrete, and glassblowing were all also inventions made by or used and perfected by the ancient Romans. The pantheon, still standing today in Rome, is the world's largest unreinforced dome. Most concrete structures today are reinforced, meaning they contain wire mesh or rebar to improve tensile strength, but the Pantheon does not. Thought that was pretty cool. Now, here's a question. How would you keep something cold or even frozen for months at a time if you didn't have a refrigerator or freezer? Well, because people back then weren't able to just move to Canada, they needed another solution. And those were ice houses dating back to about 1780 BC. We have found these in several locations, including China, Iran, Greece, and Rome. And they're basically big underground chambers with thick walls that were stuffed with insulation, like straw or sawdust, to maintain a cold temperature. And basically all it could do is slow how fast ice melted. They would gather this ice during the winter and then keep it in the ice houses for as long as possible to keep drinks cold or preserve food just like we do now. But it wouldn't be until the 1800s that practical refrigerators were invented, mostly for industrial use. And in 1913, the first home refrigerator came to market. Then you know who's stealing our jobs and just needs to go, water wheels, is what someone probably said in around 300 BC. Because these allowed us to harness energy from the water and use it for mechanical purposes by connecting the axle of the wheel to a series of gears and shafts that would crush grain into flour, taking away the need for a lot of manual labor. And it wouldn't be for another 1,000 years roughly that the first wind meal would be made in Persia also for the purpose of grinding grain and pumping water. And speaking of water, do you ever just need some but it's too far down in the well? Well, in 234 BC, this thing was invented. This is the Archimedes screw patent pending, one of the first hydraulic machines, and they are still used to this day in irrigation, hydropower generation, and wastewater management. Archimedes also did a lot. He created different systems of polis. He defined the idea of a lever and used that principle to make a weapon that would lift boats out of water. and he made a heat ray where apparently he used a series of mirrors to focus sunlight onto enemy ships which would set them on fire. Now moving on, the first digital computer, the ENIAC, was invented in 1945 to help calculate artillery firing tables for the US Army's ballistic research lab. Basically tables that would tell you what angle the fire based on the gun you're using, distance from the target, and more. But the first analog computer, well that dates back to 100 BC, known as the Antik-k-k mechanism. This was an astronomical calculator, and with its roughly 37 gears, it could track the movement of the moon, the sun, possibly the five known planets at the time, it could predict eclipses, and the phase of the moon decades into the future. This device was so advanced for its time modern scholars are still puzzled by how ancient engineers were capable of creating it. And this mechanism was an invention of the ancient Greeks, who also made the first catapult, the first crane, Archimedes, and the first alarm clock. This thing was actually invented by Plato, and essentially water would flow slowly from the top vessel to the one below. And after this second vessel was completely full, maybe after eight hours, it would quickly be emptied to the next vessel. This would force air out of a small opening, which would make a whistling sound that could wake you up. Unfortunately, there was no snooze button, so what's the point? But okay, now we're gonna make a small jump to 1620, because well, a lot happens between then and today. So we'll just skip over things like paper, Accomplices, mechanical clocks, eyeglasses, the Great Wall of China, and the printing press. But those happened before 1620. Okay, so it's 1620 and boom, the first submarine was invented by the Dutch engineer Cornelis Drebbel. It used ores to steer and it could take in and expel water to change buoyancy and go up and down as needed. forward 155 years where an American named David Bushnell designed a submarine called the Turtle to be used during the American Revolution. And on September 7th, 1776, that submarine became the first submarine to ever be used in war. But what really changed the game for transportation, among several other fields, was the steam engine. This was first built in 1698 by Thomas Savery where he said, hey if I heat up water I can use that steam to move stuff. And just like that we got the steam engine. The first application of the steam engine was to pump water out of flooded mines, but we eventually ended up putting this thing on boats, locomotives, and in textile mills and factories. This was known as the Industrial Revolution. Now, James Watt, the guy who got the power unit named after him, is the most well-known name when it comes to the steam engine. But he did not invent it. He greatly improved upon it in the 1760s, and it was after that that we got the first locomotive, the steamboat, textile machinery, and everything else associated with the Industrial Revolution, which we say did not start until James Watt made his improvements. For reference, before the steamboat, Europe to America was a six to eight week journey. By 1838, you can make that journey in about 15 days by steamboat. Now, the steam engine is an external combustion engine, which basically means the thing you burn, coal in this case, is outside the engine, as it has to make the steam first that then and moves the piston. The internal combustion engine, invented around the 1860s and 70s, was different in that its fuel, or gasoline, is burned within the engine and directly contributes to the motion of the piston. The internal combustion engine was arguably just as, if not more influential, than the steam engine, because it led to cars in 1886, first invented by Carl Benz, yes, as in Mercedes Benz. The motorcycle in 1885, the first airplane in 1903, yes, that famous Wright Brothers plane, that had an internal combustion engine on it. It also led to tractors, trucks and buses, lawnmowers, chainsaws, and snowmobiles. And it's still the engine used in almost every single form of transportation on Earth today. Now, if it was 1868 and you wanted to cross the United States, then maybe she isn't worth it because that would be a six month trek by horse. In 1869, this was brought down to about one week through the creation of the Transcontinental Railroad. This 3000 kilometer track took about six years to make and two companies were actually in charge of constructing the majority of the railroad. The Central Pacific Railroad Company started in Sacramento and had to build East. While the Union Pacific Company started near Omaha, Nebraska and built going west. Where they would meet was not predetermined, but it happened in Utah, and this is the picture of that happening. Oh, and notice, we had pictures at this point. The first picture taken was in 1826, called View from the Window at Le French Word. It got absolutely no likes. And then the first or really oldest surviving video is this right here, made in 1888. Enjoy, it's got a crazy twist ending. Actually, the story behind this does. First of all, Sarah Whitley, seen here, dies 10 days after this was filmed of natural causes. But the guy behind the camera, who also invented it, this guy here, he disappeared two years after this was taken while traveling by train to Paris. His remains were never found, and it still remains a mystery to this day what happened to him. Now gonna backtrack a little, because in 1837, the telegraph was invented. Before that, if you wanted to tell your friends something, but they lived in another state, you'd have to send a letter. With the telegraph, for the first time ever, you could communicate over long distances almost instantaneously. Although these were not in people's homes, like phones would eventually be, they had telegraph offices you would have to go to. And these are why Morse code was invented, since all that could be sent was electric pulses. And then in 1858, we stretched one of these telegraph wires across the Atlantic Ocean, connecting Ireland and Newfoundland. Yes, 2,000 kilometers of coiled cable was loaded onto a boat that started in Newfoundland, and another 2,000 kilometers were put on another boat that started in Ireland, and those boats met in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, where they would join the cables together. I can't even find the nearest Costco without GPS, but they did not have just one boat lay the entire cable due to things like the extra weight, risk of losing the entire cable versus half, and other stuff. And today, almost 600 cables run along the ocean floors, and these are what make the modern internet possible. Yeah, it's not satellites as many people think. satellite internet like Starlink is currently about 1% of internet traffic. Then the wireless telegraph or the first radio wouldn't come until 1895 when it was invented by that Marconi. His first signals could only be sent half a mile. By 1901, Marconi and his assistant sent a wireless signal across the Atlantic Ocean. And in 1912, over 700 lives were saved, because luckily there was a wireless telegraph made by the Marconi Company onboard the Titanic. And it was that wireless telegraph that sent out the distress signals to nearby ships. Then in 1878, hydroelectric power was invented when William Armstrong used running water to produce electricity which powered a single lamp in his art gallery. Now hydroelectric is responsible for powering 17% of the world and it's led to other engineering marvels like the Hoover Dam. Then one year after the hydroelectric generator, in 1879 we got the first practical light bulb. Now the first electric light was invented over 70 years earlier in 1802 by Humphrey Davy. So no, Thomas Edison did not invent the electric light and neither did anyone he worked with. But Edison did work on improving the design of the light bulb and eventually he helped design the first practical incandescent light bulb. The difference? Humphrey's invention in 1802 involved electricity jumping through the air known as an electric arc where it produced light that was apparently super bright, like way too bright for regular use and it might not even last 30 minutes. Edison's bulb used a filament or thin wire that would glow when electric current passed through it and it could last 1200 hours. These would be the main light bulbs used until the 1990s. But Edison did something else that isn't talked about as much. He created the first electric grid. He needed a way to actually power these light bulbs in people's homes, and thus the Pearl Street station in New York City became the world's first central power plant in 1882. Oh, and that power plant used direct current, or DC power, not alternating. But some people were saying alternating current, AC, was better and could be transmitted further, including Nikola Tesla. and investors in Europe actually developed some of the earliest AC systems. But in 1890, the arguably first commercial hydroelectric AC power plant was constructed in Colorado. Oh, also Tesla invented the induction motor, the Tesla coil, the first remote control specifically for a boat, and like 300 other things he patented. Then the first subway was the London Underground in 1863, and the first phone call ever made was in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell to his assistant where he famously said, Mr. Watson is your girlfriend single. But now we need to move on to the next century. Okay, in 1913, if you wanted to sail from New York to California, well enjoy your trip around South America, which would take five to eight months. But in 1914, the Panama Canal was opened. This little shortcut through Panama cut over 12,000 kilometers from the journey and shortened a 5-8 month expedition to 2-3 weeks. They made this canal by blowing up a big chunk of Mother Earth, like they took dynamite and blew up miles of mountains, dug through dense jungle terrain, and excavated over 200 million tons of rock and dirt. Then after 8 years of work from the French, yes this project was originally given to the French led by the guy who made the Suez Canal, then another 10 years from the United States who eventually took over, this 65 kilometer canal was finished. And this thing is like an elevator for boats. Pretty crazy. Now, can you guess what one of the biggest drivers of innovation during the 20th century was? War. What is it good for? CEOs. Tanks were invented during World War I, same with unmanned aircrafts, mobile X-ray machines, and sanitary napkins. Then World War II, that led to penicillin, jet engines, the electronic computer, radar, the nuclear bomb, and most importantly, the microwave, discovered accidentally while working on radar. It happened after this guy noticed his snack had melted while working with a magnetron, which is a device that emits microwaves, which we use for radar systems. And in between those wars in 1927, we got the television, which has an interesting David and Goliath story. It was Philo Farnsworth who made the first working electronic television in 1927. But he faced several legal battles with the Radio Corporation of America, RCA, a giant company that claimed Farnsworth's invention fringe on their patents. It would take decades for Farnsworth to receive the recognition he deserved, and he also would not let his kids watch any TV while growing up. But he made one exception, and that was watching the moment that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon, to which he said, this has made it all worthwhile. He is now known as the father of television, but he only appeared once on the device he invented. This is the famous Dr. Philo T. Farnsworth who invented electronic television. Okay, now let's power through. The transistor was invented in 1947. This is the key component in integrated circuits, and there's billions of them in whatever you are watching this video on. And without them, we would not have modern cell phones, computers, TVs, digital cameras, medical imaging devices, or the Xbox. The first satellite, Sputnik, was launched in 1957 by the Soviet Union. It was just a radio transmitter that could send little beeps, and this is what started the space race between the Soviet Union and the US. And while you may know that the US lost the race to get the first satellite and person into space, you might not know they also came in second when it came to landing something on Mars, which the Soviet Union did in 1971, lasting only 110 seconds until the lander stopped working. Then the laser was built in 1960, and this led to CDs and DVDs, barcode scanners, laser printers, fiber optic communication, laser eye surgery, and a new way to entertain your cat. Then while we may not have flying cars yet, we have made magnetic levitation trains, or maglevs, and the first one available to the public debuted in 1984 in England. But as of today, there are only six that are operational, three in China, two in South Korea, and one in Japan. And these have reached speeds of 373 miles per hour, or about 600 kilometers per hour. 1977 was when the first person was scanned by an MRI machine. These could be used to find much more than an x-ray could, such as brain tumors and neurological conditions, spinal cord injuries, and soft tissue problems. 1984 is actually when the first truly autonomous car started being worked on. CRISPR revolutionized genetic engineering when it was unveiled in 2012, and this is like a surgical tool for DNA as it can actually edit genes and correct genetic sequences that cause disease.

After all, using electronics to engineer the world of the future is pretty badass. Let's debunk the public myths of what it means to be an electrical engineer and give it to you straight. This is the reality of electrical engineering. To start, you might be asking yourself, what even is electrical engineering? To answer that, electrical engineering is the fuel that electrifies innovation, sparking breakthroughs in the seemingly magical devices of today. It's an essential profession on every project from the James Webb Space Telescope to play stations and popcorn machines. You can find these engineers applying their math, physics and computer science skills to develop intricate electrical highways known as printed circuit boards. These circuit boards route electrical signals to and from electrical components to accomplish everything from a mundane computer startup to controlling the sheer power and precision of a rocket's ascension out of Earth's atmosphere. Electrical engineers are the engineering jack of all trades as they utilize programming, hardware, and physical properties in their work, whereas other professions tend to mostly stick to one. No matter which way you look at it, electrical engineering is an exciting, lucrative field with tons of niche subfields to explore. explore. But before we dive into the details, we'll explore the day to day responsibilities that all electrical engineers share. Particle accelerators, rockets, smartphones, and modern electric vehicles were all meticulously designed with hundreds of millions of basic electrical building blocks that every electrical engineer must know, resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors. As you can imagine, completing every single connection for that many components is not the work of just one engineer. To streamline collaboration, electrical engineers use a standard documentation scheme known as electrical schematics. A schematic is a visual representation of every single connection on a circuit. Electrical engineers must be very comfortable using them if they ever intend to get anything done. Trying to communicate a circuit without a schematic would be like trying to explain how each and every highway connects across the Western United States. Obviously, you need a drawing to get the point across. Once a schematic is made and electrical engineers get their physical designs, they must measure and test them to validate their work. All electrical engineers work with lab equipment specifically designed to generate and quantify electrical signals. For example, an electrical engineer will use a tool known as a signal generator to introduce an electrical signal to their circuit board. The The board layout herds the signal throughout the circuit, like water naturally flowing down the banks of a river. The components in the circuit respond to the signal and change its characteristics, like an amplifier component boosting the signal to be 10 times stronger. But how will our engineer know if the amplifier worked? They can view this amplification by connecting the board to a different lab tool known as an oscilloscope. This is a key piece of equipment in any EES lab setup that allows the engineer to see what is actually going on in the circuit, allowing them to see if the amplifier worked or not. There are tons of other pieces of lab equipment that electrical engineers must know about to test electrical designs, but we'll save that discussion for another day. Now that you have an idea of the responsibilities of electrical engineers, we can transition into a view of the most sought after subfields that build on these important duties. We'll start with Power Systems Engineers, or Power Engineers. These engineers are dedicated to the generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical power. They accomplish this by designing, operating, and maintaining electrical power systems. You can find a power engineer spearheading the design of a national power grid that supplies energy to every corner of a nation. On a smaller but just as cool scale, you can find these engineers designing motors that convert electrical energy into another form of energy. This can turn an axle and drive the wheels on the newest Tesla model or ignite an electric plasma motor for jet acceleration. You can also find power engineers enhancing our world by finding creative new ways to harness the power of natural energy from the ocean, sun and wind. So if you find yourself interested in revolutionizing the world's usage of electrical power on a small, national or global scale, power engineering could be the right path for you. Now we'll explore telecommunications engineering, or more specifically, radio frequency and microwave engineering. And to answer your question, microwave engineers do not design microwave ovens. Radio frequency and microwave engineers use very high frequency circuits and electromagnetic waves of energy to transfer messages. These engineers are in demand across various industries such as aerospace, defense, medical devices and consumer electronics. RF and microwave engineers can be found figuring out the best way to securely encode a signal for transmission and implementing the circuitry to do so. For example, a radio station takes the audio signal that is your favorite Katy Perry song and modulates it, meaning that it is encoded as a high frequency and ready to travel through the air. It is then received and demodulated by the the radio in your bedroom so that you and your pissed off neighbors can hear it nice and clearly. These engineers can also be found assisting the medical field. For example, with MRI machines, an MRI uses radio frequency pulses and magnetic fields to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the body, giving medical professionals invaluable insight on their patients. So if you're interested in electromagnetic waves zooming through space or enhancing the lives of countless medical patients, RF and microwave engineering could be the profession for you. Next, we take a deeper look at signal processing engineers. Signal processing engineers create electronics and algorithms that analyze, manipulate, and interpret signals to extract useful information and maximize the efficiency of electrical devices and systems. These engineers are very knowledgeable in data manipulating mathematics and programming insanely efficient algorithms. A perfect example is found at the core of the newest Apple augmented reality headset. Signal processing engineers first create an algorithm that takes in all the data from the headsets of various cameras and sensors. It is then able to quickly recognize, say, a pair of eyes darting to a widget on the home screen. Then, like magic, the algorithm instantly highlights the widget in sight, ready for the user to click on it at a moment's notice. As you can imagine, these engineers are also in very high demand as nearly all systems and products of today require data manipulation of electrical signals to perform properly. So if you have a good mathematical foundation, understand what it takes to efficiently accomplish a goal and want to engineer the mind boggling devices of the future, you might consider becoming a signal processing engineer. Alright, now that you have a general idea of what electrical engineers do and have insight on a few of the most popular subfields, we're ready to take you into the enticing and not so enticing aspects of electrical engineering. To kick off the ugly side of electrical engineering, we look at the abstract, confusing nature of the profession. All of the exciting designs we've discussed so far in this video work by electric and magnetic fields moving energy around, which is invisible to the naked eye and extremely tough for the human brain to comprehend. It takes an especially imaginative and determined individual to successfully overcome this abstraction hurdle, which deters most people. Further electrical engineers typically go through a lot of programming in their upbringings, which alongside all of the circuit work means that they have to deal with software and hardware instead of just picking a lane like other engineering professions. Another con to electrical engineering is the never ending technical obsolescence. You could have been the industry genius that pioneered the invention known as the flip phone, but a few short years later find yourself submitting your dust cover design to a local museum for ancient artifacts. In this field, the desire for smaller, faster and more efficient technology never ends, which can be a tiring endeavor for anyone. But if you are an imaginative, abstract thinker that enjoys the subject and welcomes the evolutionary nature of technology, all of these downsides suddenly turn into upsides. Moving into the exciting parts of electrical engineering, we remember that it's a very broad profession with tons of subfields. This vast applicability to many niches corresponds to a high demand and excellent career stability for electrical engineers. Further, society continues to trend toward more reliance on electrical devices, making the outlook for these engineers even more fruitful. And another bonus, they typically get to work hybrid remote. Seeing as most electrical engineers get to develop software, and this is obviously done on a computer, they can work comfortably from their own home, or wherever else they can code productively. And if that wasn't enough for you, electrical engineers get paid exceptionally well, even more than most other engineering professions. The crazy technical and abstract nature of the profession, mixed with the dense population of subfields, is a recipe for financial success. They also spend their entire career finding better ways to get the job done, making themselves ever more valuable and in turn, wealthy. So if you could see yourself enjoying the technical side of electrical engineering and want a well-paying, stable job with great benefits, we think you should take a serious look at becoming an electrical engineer. So do you want to become an electrical engineer? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments. If you think you have what it takes to become an engineer, watch this video to find out just how right or wrong you are.
