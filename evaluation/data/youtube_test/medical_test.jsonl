Medicine that slides down your throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle. But how does it get where it needs to go in the first place? The answer is that it hitches a ride in your circulatory bloodstream, cycling through your body in a race to do its job before it's snared by organs and molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances. This process starts in your digestive system. Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet for a sore ankle. Within minutes the tablet starts disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach. The dissolved ibuprofen travels into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall into a network of blood vessels. These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood and anything in it to the liver. The next step is to make it through the liver. As the blood and the drug molecules in it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with the ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them. The damaged ibuprofen molecules, called metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers. At this stage, most of the ibuprofen makes it through the liver unscathed. It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system. Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it into the circulatory bloodstream. This blood loop travels through every limb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys, and back through the liver. When ibuprofen molecules encounter a location where the body's pain response is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules that are part of that reaction. Pain killers like ibuprofen block the production of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals. As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain-canceling effect increases, reaching a maximum within about one or two hours. Then the body starts efficiently eliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half every two hours on average. When the ibuprofen molecules detach from their targets, the systemic bloodstream carries them away again. Back in the liver, another small fraction of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out by the kidneys in the urine. The loop from liver to body to kidneys continues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized and filtered out in each cycle. These basic steps are the same for any drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes it into your bloodstream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body. The dosing instructions on medicine labels can help, but their average is based on a sample population that doesn't represent every consumer. And getting the dose right is important. If it's too low, the medicine won't do its job. If it's too high, the drug and its metabolites can be toxic. true of any drug. One of the hardest groups of patients to get the right dosage for are children. That's because how they process medicine changes quickly, as do their bodies. For instance, the level of liver enzymes that neutralize medication highly fluctuates during infancy and childhood. And that's just one of many complicating factors. Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's efficiency of processing medicine. Someday, routine DNA tests may be able to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency and other factors. But in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor or pharmacist and taking the recommended amounts with the recommended timing.", "transcript_length": 636, "reference_summary": "When you swallow a painkiller like ibuprofen, it embarks on a journey through your body to alleviate pain.

Please get active to help your heart. Otherwise, such a lifestyle is known for causing a heart attack. Really? How? Well, let us explore that by answering a heart-breaking question. What causes a heart attack? Zoom in! The human heart, a marvel of biological engineering, is responsible for pumping life-sustaining blood throughout the body. However, this vital organ is not unstoppable, and one of the most feared cardiovascular events is a heart attack claiming around 7 million lives worldwide every year but what causes it in the first place? You see, like all muscles, a heart needs oxygen to function properly it gets the supply of oxygenated blood from vessels called coronary arteries However, due to various reasons, fatty deposits or plaque start developing on the walls of these arteries. At times, these fatty plaques can get hardened, lumpy or inflamed, causing a partial blockage that reduces the flow of oxygenated blood. If this plaque ruptures, your body perceives it as any other injury and within minutes starts to form blood clots around it, leading to the complete blockage of the artery. As a result, blood flow is cut off to the heart muscles and oxygen-starved cells begin to die within a few minutes, leading to a heart attack. known as myocardial infarction. If help is not received immediately, things may go downhill as the heart will stop pumping blood. And in worst case scenario, the person may pass away. So it's vital to understand the warning signs to identify the lurking threat of a heart attack. And what are they? The most common signs include crushing chest pain or discomfort that may spread to the left arm, neck, jaw or back. At times there are other subtle signs such as shortness of breath, cold sweats, nausea and lightheadedness. For women and older people, constant tiredness and weakness can be a major sign of a weak heart. Not only that but certain things make a heart attack more likely like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, being overweight and not being active. So if you notice people showing any of the said symptoms with no sign of improvement then it's better to immediately take them to the nearest hospital. The doctor might do a test called an electrocardiogram or ECG to check the heart's electricity and a blood test for muscle damage. If they find a problem, the cardiologist can do an angioplasty using a fin tube with a balloon to clear blockages in the artery. In serious situations, doctors might do bypass surgery. They take a piece of vein from another part of the body and redirect the blood flow around the blockage to fix the heart. But remember, it's better to prevent problems by making lifestyle changes, which can significantly lower the risk of a heart attack. Yes, to keep your heart strong, eat healthy foods like fruits and veggies, play and move around for regular exercise and stay away from smoking. Listen to your body, get enough sleep and manage stress with relaxing activities like drawing or playing. Remember, small steps every day can make a big difference in keeping your heart healthy and strong. To know more, check our video, How Your Heart Works. Trivia Time! Did you know a heart attack can happen suddenly without a person knowing it? Yes, this is referred to as a silent heart attack. And these account for one in five heart attacks. It's sketching time. Today's sketch of the day goes to Lojas. Hope you learned something new today. Until next time, it's me, Dr. Binocz, zooming out. Never mind.", "transcript_length": 618, "reference_summary": "The text discusses the importance of heart health and the causes of heart attacks, emphasizing the need for an active lifestyle.

It's been with us for three million years since before humans were homo sapiens. We have evidence of it in the mummies of ancient Egypt, and it's mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. We have made extraordinary medical advances. Vaccines, antibiotics, and clean water have saved millions of lives. And yet, despite that, in 2022, this disease killed more people than malaria, typhoid, cholera, homicide, and war combined. It has gone by many names. In ancient China, it was known as waifu, meaning destroyed palace. In ancient Hebrew, shakafeth, meaning wasting away. the 19th century term, consumption, for the way it seemed to consume the body. Today, we call it tuberculosis. But tuberculosis is more than just a disease. It reveals fundamental truths about who we are as human beings and how we have changed or failed to change throughout history. We're powerful enough to light the world at night, to artificially refrigerate food, to reshape the balance of gases in the atmosphere. And we've even identified the cure to TB. So why are so many people still dying of it? I've always found it strange that in studying history, we tend to focus so little on disease. It's something like 90% of people die of disease, a phenomenon so entrenched in human life that we describe many such deaths as natural causes. And yet, if you attend a college survey on the history of humans, you will learn more of wars and empires and trade routes than of microbes. As Virginia Woolf wrote, and on being ill, it is strange indeed that illness has not taken its place with love, battle, and jealousy among the prime themes of literature. Or put another way, Hamlet never gets a headache, but the rest of us do. I suspect that we want to imagine we choose our fate, that human history is largely the story of human choice. Like perhaps that's why rumors swirled that Alexander the Great died of poisoning, even even though he almost certainly died of typhoid or malaria. We simply don't want a world where even the world's most successful emperor can be felled by mere infection. And yet that is the world we live in, a world where disease shapes history in profound ways. But also a world where history shapes disease, like anyone can get tuberculosis, but not Not everyone has an equal chance of getting it, and certainly not everyone has an equal chance of dying from it. To understand why, I had to go back, way back, to discover how our earliest understandings of TB evolved alongside culture into the problem we're now facing. First, let me give you a very basic overview of our current understanding of the disease, which can be summarized as, tuberculosis is weird. It's an infectious disease, meaning it's caused by germs, like COVID-19, it's spread through the air we breathe, and you might be surprised to learn that around a quarter of all humans are currently infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis. But only about 5-10% of them will ever progress to what is called active disease, which is when the infection makes you chronically sick. If an infection does proceed to active disease, it usually happens within two years of the initial infection, but TB also may lie dormant for decades before suddenly exploding. What causes this progression to active disease? Well, again, it's complicated. We don't fully know, but risk factors include malnutrition, lack of access to medical care, crowded housing conditions, and a severely compromised immune system, especially from insufficiently treated HIV infection. But even once the disease becomes active, its course is extremely unpredictable. It may kill its victims within a few weeks or over many years. It usually attacks the lungs, but can also invade other organs like the brain, or pancreas, or spinal column. For reasons we don't fully understand, some patients will recover without treatment. But most, if left untreated, will eventually die of tuberculosis. Much of the strangeness here is related to the bacterium itself. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has an unusually fatty, thick cell wall, which makes it difficult for infection-fighting cells to destroy the bacteria. So instead, the bacteria is surrounded, first by one white blood cell, and then by many, which creates this ball of calcifying tissue called a tubercle. As long as these vaguely spherical tubercles hold the bacteria within them, active disease never develops, but if the bacteria escapes and the immune system isn't strong enough to surround all the new bacteria with tubercles, the body can slowly be overwhelmed by infection, eventually leading to death. Now because it takes so long to build the complicated fortress of its cell wall, mycobacterium tuberculosis has an incredibly slow growth rate compared to other bacteria. Like in laboratory environments, E. coli divides and doubles about once every 20 minutes, mycobacterium tuberculosis divides about once per day. And so infections simply take longer to make a person sick. In short, TB is not like a plague that sweeps through a community where one member of a household gets sick and everyone else in the household is sick three days later. It's not like a cancer or heart disease that affects one person in a home but rarely spreads to others. And it's not like an E. coli infection where you get violently sick all at once. And being so fundamentally different from other infections is precisely why the classical understandings of tuberculosis varied so widely, and why even today the stories we tell ourselves about the disease reveal at least as much about humans as they do about tuberculosis. So it wouldn't be accurate to say that we thought of tuberculosis one way or another in antiquity. We thought of it many different ways. Some communities believed the disease was genetic, others thought it was contagious, some thought it was caused by foul air, others by a disharmony of fluids within the body. Some even approached a germ theory of disease, like hundreds of years before humans invented the microscope, the Great Persian scholar and poet Ibn Sina wrote that diseases such as TB were caused by tainted foreign organisms that are not visible by naked eye. Which, very impressive, but no way to confirm it pre-microscopy. I want to pause here to note a defining feature of humans, which is that we like to know why things happen, especially why really bad things happen. And if a reason is not immediately apparent, we will find one. I'm reminded of a short poem by Kurt Vonnegut. Tiger got a hunt, bird got a fly, man got a sit and wonder why, why, why. Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land, man got to tell himself he understand. And this brings us to an important facet of understanding human responses to illness, stigma. As part of our desire to answer the question, why, why, why, by telling ourselves we understand, humans commonly construct moral and ethical narratives around illness. Like my dad had cancer twice when I was a kid, and I saw some of this firsthand. People kept their distance from us. Some said he got cancer because his parents smoked, or because he didn't exercise enough, or because he didn't eat broccoli, or whatever. And it's true that second-hand smoke and poor diet are risk factors for cancer, but it's also true that the vast majority of people whose parents smoked do not get cancer when they are a 32-year-old father of two young kids. We do not want to reckon with a world that is merely unfair, where some people get sick, not because they did something wrong, but because the world is unjust, and insofar as it is just, it's random. And so we tell ourselves we understand, which too often means creating explanations that blame the sufferer. Stigma is a way of saying, you deserved this to happen. But implied within the stigma is also, and I don't deserve it. And so I don't need to worry about it happening to me. Stigma can become a kind of double burden for the sick. In addition to living with the physical and psychological challenges of illness, there's the additional challenge of having their humanity discounted. Think of the word universally used in English to describe tuberculosis patients in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were called invalids. They were literally invalid. People living with TB today have told me that fighting the disease was hard, but fighting the stigma of their communities was even harder. Now stigma is very complex, of course, but researchers have identified certain hallmarks of highly stigmatized illnesses. Chronic illnesses are more likely to be stigmatized than acute ones, for instance, as are illnesses with high levels of perceived peril. And critically for understanding tuberculosis, stigma can be compounded if a disease is understood to be infectious. Finally, the origin or perceived origin of a disease also matters. If an illness is seen to be the result of choice, it is much more likely to be stigmatized. So for instance, people with major depression are often told to just choose to be happier, just as those with substance abuse disorders are told to just choose to quit drinking. And some cancers and heart diseases are stigmatized for resulting from purported choice as well. Of course, this is not how biology works. Illness has no moral compass. It does not punish the evil and reward the good. It doesn't know about evil and good, but we want life to be a story that makes sense, which is why, for example, it was commonly believed up until the middle of the 20th century that cancer was caused by things like social isolation. Parents were actually told their kids got leukemia because they hadn't been adequately loved as infants. If a clear cause and effect isn't present, we will invent one, even if it's cruel, because tigers got asleep, and birds got a land, and man got to tell himself he understand. TB occupies an interesting place in this conversation. It's a chronic disease with high levels of perceived peril, but it wasn't always understood to be infectious, and in much of the world, it wasn't seen as a choice. And yet, TB was a highly stigmatized disease. It was often associated with demon possession or excessive alcohol consumption or moral frailty. But in northern Europe, beginning in the mid-18th century, it became untenable to understand the disease then known as consumption through only a stigmatic lens. The disease had exploded, especially in Britain's cities and North American colonies. Stigmatizing away an illness becomes harder when everyone seems to be getting it, not just the poor or the vulnerable, but even the rich. I mean, the richest individual of the 19th century died of TB at the age of 56. It killed presidents and kings and poets and actresses. And so suddenly consumption became a romanticized disease, a disease of beauty and refinement and intellectual sophistication. Death and decay are often beautiful, Henry David Thoreau wrote, like the pearly tear of the shellfish or the hectic glow of consumption. So it may be tempting to think that romanticizing a disease would be better than stigmatizing it, But as somebody who suffers from mental illness, I understand firsthand that the two aren't entirely separable. Like, both strategies ultimately other the sufferer, imagining them as somehow removed from the social order. Mental illness is often romanticized as unwellness that brings on creative genius or other superpowers. But of course, mental illness is also heavily stigmatized in our culture. And so romanticization and stigmatization are essentially like complementary strategies for casting people out of society and finding a story that makes sense for why those people ended up sick. In the case of consumption, this romanticization goes deep and wide. Like once you start noticing the impacts of this story on contemporary culture, you start to wonder if there's anything in our lives today that's not connected to TB. So classically, consumption was viewed as a disease of the air. It was an illness of the breath of the place where the body interacts with the atmosphere. Consider many of our words for the human soul, the Hebrew rock, the Chinese chi, the English spirit, and the Inuit sila, all derive from words meaning breath or breathing. Breath is life. To be inspired is literally to breathe in. To be expired is literally to breathe all the way out. And so it was easy to make this disease of breath into a disease of the spirit, the chi, the sila, and the ruach. So much so that at times, consumptives were seen as paragons of brilliance and beauty. In men, consumption was believed to bring creative powers to new levels. Scholars pointed to the fact that everyone from Stephen Crane to Frederick Chopin to the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty died of consumption. Less attention was paid to the fact that in a world where roughly 30% of all northern Europeans were dying of a disease, it shouldn't be particularly surprising that many northern European artists and writers were dying of it. But like one magazine at the time linked TB to authors in particular, writing that an author's waywardness, peevishness, irascibility, misanthropy, and murky passions are referable to their constitutional peculiarities and condition. In simple words, that their mental eccentricities result from the derangement of bodily health. And that's precisely what I mean when I say that romanticization is not a kind or generous way of treating the ill. I am an author, and I for one am deeply offended by the notion that my waywardness, peevishness, irascibility, misanthropy, and murky passions are caused by a derangement of bodily health, even as I am impressed by a 19th century magazine's ability to absolutely nail my personality. It's hard to overstate how profound the link between consumption and male creative genius was believed to be. It is said that Victor Hugo's friends, for instance, joked with him that he could have been a truly great novelist if only he'd contracted consumption. Lord Byron wrote, I should like, I think, to die of consumption, because then the women would all say, see that poor Byron, how interesting he looks in dying. And if men in Northern Europe were believed to achieve via consumption greater artistic and creative heights, then women were believed to become more beautiful and ethereal and wondrously pure. As Charlotte Bronte put it two years after the publication of her novel Jane Eyre, Consumption, I am aware, is a flattering malady. That flattering malady, incidentally, would kill Charlotte, and also all three of her sisters. Patients with active TB typically become pale and thin, with rosy cheeks and wide, sunken eyes due to the low blood oxygenation and fevers that accompany the disease. Like the English actor Eliza Poe, whose beauty was widely admired, looked stereotypically tubercular. Her rosy cheeks, alabaster skin, wide eyes, and tiny body were all the result of consumption, which killed her in 1811, when she was 23 or 24, and her son Edgar was two. Edgar Allen Poe would go on to describe many of the women in his stories and poems as similarly wispy, pale, and large-eyed. By the time of Eliza's death, so-called consumptive chic had taken over European beauty standards. American and European magazines encouraged women to apply the poison belladonna to their eyelids, to dilate their pupils, so they could have that wide-eyed consumptive look, and offered instructions for how to apply red paint to the lips and cheeks to capture the hectic glow of consumptive fevers. I probably do not need to point out that from runway shows to fashion magazines, these standards of beauty are still molding what is considered to be feminine beauty. But TB shaped not only the makeup and beauty standards of the era, but also fashion, which for women sought to emphasize the visible symptoms of illness. The most glaring such clothing was the pointed corset, which emphasized the narrowness of women's wastes. The similarity, by the way, between waste and waste is an etymological coincidence in English, but a telling one. These corsets were so restrictive that women were limited in the kinds of physical activities they could accomplish and struggled to get full breaths of air, both of which mirrored the experience of actual consumption. And so consumption had become fully glamorous and idealized. There is a dread disease, Charles Dickens wrote in Nicholas Nicolby, in which the struggle between soul and body is so gradual, quiet, and solemn that the spirit grows light and sanguine with its lightning load. Dickens did not name the disease, nor did his readers need him to. everyone knew of the disease that shrank the body and enlarged the soul. But of course this all belies the true violence of consumption. Perhaps the most famous 19th century victim of tuberculosis was the English poet John Keats. When Keats's body was autopsied a couple days after his death at the age of 25, the doctor wrote, the lungs were completely gone. This was and is the truth of death by tuberculosis. The afflicted often drown as blood and pus fills their lungs. They die starved of oxygen in agony. Here is where the romanticization of tuberculosis becomes, believe it or not, even more insidious, because underlying all these shifts was a feeling that consumption was, as some 18th century observers put it, a disease of civilization. People at the time knew that city dwellers were far more likely to develop consumption than those in rural communities, and this concept of consumption as a civilized disease also meant that it could not be a disease of uncivilized people, which led to a racialization of the illness. In Europe and the US, most white doctors believed that TB could only infect white people, and it was sometimes known as the white man's plague. One American doctor, for instance, called it a disease of the master race, not of the slave race. As Frank Snowden writes, In the United States, the prevailing wisdom was that African Americans contracted a different disease. This phenomenon also extended to other colonial empires. Many European colonialists believe that TB was either rare or non-existent among people of color. In reality, there was extensive illness and death from consumption in colonial South Asia and Africa, and many local health care providers sought to bring attention to the crisis. But it went undetected and uncounted by colonial authorities because the entire premise of colonialism relied on white supremacy, and the genetic understanding of consumption relied upon the idea that only supreme people could contract it. Acknowledging that consumption was common among enslaved, colonized, and marginalized people would have undermined not just the theory of consumption, but the project of colonialism itself. Toward the end of the 19th century, the romanticization of consumption began to decline, as it became increasingly obvious that the illness was not exclusively, or even primarily, a disease of the rich and brilliant. Scholars had begun to turn their eyes away from the languorous fainting young women and their romantic lovers, write Ren\u00e9e and Jean Dubot. They noticed instead the miserable humanity living in the dreary tenements born of the industrial revolution. In the tentacular cities they saw hosts of men, women, and children pale too, often cold and starving, working long hours in dark and crowded shops, breathing smoke and cold dust. Tuberculosis was there, breeding suffering and misery without romance. Still, arguments raged over what caused the disease. Until 1882, when a vexatious little organism called m-tobirculosus was first identified by the physician Robert Koch. Over the next few years, the replication and acceptance of Koch's research meant that the era of consumption as an inherited condition that grew the soul by shrinking the body slowly faded away. No longer could Could consumption be understood as an inherited condition shaped by sad passion and wondrously translucent skin? Now it was a germ disease, an illness of filth and overcrowding and poverty. The era of tuberculosis had begun. Today, we understand the explosion of TB in the 19th century to have been primarily a result of the Industrial Revolution, which led to cramped living conditions in cities where workers could easily spread TB to one another, and where widespread malnutrition, an important risk factor for developing active disease, made people especially vulnerable. And so just as Britain was ground zero for the Industrial Revolution, it was ground zero for the rise of tuberculosis. And we've seen TB grow with industrialization in other communities as well, from India to Nigeria. TB's parallel journey with capital, as Vidya Krishnan puts it, has been seen in outbreak after outbreak. But at the time, industrialization wasn't seen as the culprit. Instead, as understandings of TB shifted to being about poverty rather than romance, racialized stigma did a 180, whereas before black and brown people were seen as incapable of getting such a beautiful disease, now they were blamed for it. The Negro race suffers from tuberculosis tainting the country, one American official wrote. Racialized medicine no longer maintained that high rates of consumption among white people was a sign of white superiority. Instead, racialized medicine now maintained that high rates of consumption among black people was a sign of white superiority. But of course, none of that was true. Black people were not more susceptible to TB because of factors inherent to race. They were more susceptible to tuberculosis because of racism. TB especially preys on those who are marginalized not because of their choices or habits, but because they are marginalized. It's important to note that all this racialized medicine was challenged. It was obvious hogwash from the beginning, and there was loud rejection, especially from black healthcare workers. After a white doctor claimed the Negro is to blame for his own susceptibility to tuberculosis, a black physician wrote a response, arguing that this kind of racialized medicine smacked more of the cheap politicians seeking notoriety and office by playing to passion and prejudice than a doctor discussing philosophically a scientific subject for the diffusion of knowledge, which is the doctor version of an extraordinarily sick burn. And in fact, this bias against marginalized people and the healthcare workers serving them has proven to be one of the great facilitators of tuberculosis over the last century. Even after establishing that tuberculosis was an infectious disease caused by a bacterium, nobody was quite sure how this disease spread. But man gotta tell himself he understand, and so attention came to focus on the kinds of places and environments that seemed to foster outbreaks of tuberculosis, crowded housing tenements, and dirty factories. Some public health efforts did make a significant impact, covering one's cough or sneeze with a handkerchief, which really did lessen the risk of spreading TB, as did discouraging spitting in public places like trolley cars and sidewalks, which was common in the US at the time. People were also told not to kiss babies, or kiss at all. Another obsession was with dirt and dust, which again changed fashion, grooming, and social habits. There is no way of computing the number of bacteria and noxious germs that may work in the Amazonian jungles of a well-whiskered face, but their numbers must be legion,\" argued Dr. Edwin Bowers in 1916. Fear of TB germs getting caught in beards led to what Harper's Weekly called the Revolt Against the Whisker, ushering in an era of clean shaves. For women, hemlines grew shorter as anxiety rose that floor-length dresses might pick pick up TB germs off dirty floors. Vidyakrishnan points out that as women's hemlines rose a few inches at the beginning of the 1900s, shoes became an important feature of women's fashion. By the early 20th century, entire industries had grown up in the US to try to treat tuberculosis. I got the blues, the TV blues, I got the heebie-teebie, TV blues. Dry air, sunshine, and rest were believed to be the best available treatments, and so sanitariums where consumptives could rest and breathe fresh air popped up around the world. And the dark can say beyond your way Southern California came to be known as the land of new lungs and in a mass migration that rivaled the Gold Rush, consumptive patients traveled west and if they survived began families, which reshaped the landscape of the United States. By 1920, around 10% of all people living in New Mexico were TB patients living in sanitariums, where the dry air and open spaces were said to heal the lungs. Blue and low down, way, way down, low down. Aiming for that knockout showdown. Built into that special day. When the dark can say beyond your way. Life in these sanitariums could be excruciatingly dull for the sufferer. The job of the so-called invalid was to improve their health by lying very still. Like one sanitarian patient, Elizabeth Mooney, wrote, I do nothing all day except lie here staring at the mountains. I wish they would rearrange them a bit. Family members were discouraged from visiting the sick, not only because visits risked spreading infection, but also because visits were seen as detrimental to health. People might get excited, and you couldn't be excited because you had to rest. Often, you were discouraged even from reading books. And there was no YouTube. Many patients did recover in sanitariums. Rest and adequate nutrition are much better for the body than malnourishment and stress. But recovery rates don't seem to have been much higher for those taking the so-called traveling cure than for those who lived at home as invalids. Nonetheless, separating millions of the ill from their homes did decrease the spread of the disease within families and combined with better overall nutrition, safer housing, and lower rates of poverty, tuberculosis declined around the world. Between 1882 and 1930, overall mortality from the disease in the US fell by around 80%. But those improvements were not evenly distributed in the American population. The declines for African Americans and Chinese Americans were much lower, and for Indigenous people, there was very little decline at all. Even as we developed better tools to diagnose and treat tuberculosis, including everything from the stethoscope to the x-ray machine to chest drains, the illness was still fundamentally incurable. But then, between 1940 and 1965, eight different classes of drugs that kill M tuberculosis were discovered and synthesized. There was, however, of course, a catch. Because the tuberculosis bacteria with its waxy coating is uncommonly hard to kill, each of these drugs needed to be administered long-term in order to be effective, and that meant the bacteria had more time to develop resistance to drugs. On top of that, no single drug was capable of curing TB on its own, so it wasn't until the mid-1950s that a combination treatment involving three different drugs was tested and approved. And for the first time in human history, tuberculosis became curable. As treatment, case-finding, and contact tracing improved, new cases of TB were able to be identified and treated. But in impoverished communities, which had for so long been believed by the rich world to be immune to TB, the illness continued to kill millions every year. Attempts to get combination therapy to colonize regions were haphazard and inconsistent, forcing many people in poor communities to find whatever antibiotics they could, regardless of their effectiveness against TB. In 2000, the Ugandan physician Dr. Peter Mugeni gave a speech about the global failure to get HIV drugs into impoverished communities. Where are the drugs? He asked. The drugs are where the disease is not. And where is the disease? The disease is where the drugs are not. So too was the case with tuberculosis. By the mid-1960s, curative therapy for TB was available everywhere, except for where it was most needed. I mentioned earlier that in the 25 years between 1940 and 1965, eight different classes of drugs were developed to treat tuberculosis. And then in the 47 years between 1965 and 2012, no new drugs were synthesized to treat tuberculosis. The reason for this is straightforward. As TB declined in rich countries, the profit incentive for researching new drugs went away, and as a result, funding dried up. When TB ceased to be a problem of rich people, it not only ceased to be romanticized, it also ceased to exist in the minds of many. But a system of pharmaceutical research driven exclusively by profit incentive is of course not the only way to develop drugs. As Dr. Carol Mitnick has told me, the failure to develop drugs for illnesses that are not seen as profitable is a human-manufactured problem that needs a human solution. If medications were a public good, the burden of disease would drive the priorities of the industry and TB treatment would be varied and plentiful. In short, there is nothing inevitable about living in a world where developing drugs that lengthen eyelashes is more highly rewarded than developing drugs that treat tuberculosis. So all of this combined to keep the rates of TB death steady in much of the developing world even as it declined precipitously in rich nations. And then, beginning in the early 1980s, physicians and activists in the Global South began to sound the alarm about an explosion in uncommonly swift and severe tuberculosis deaths that seem to be associated with a new pandemic, that of HIV AIDS. Because untreated HIV lowers resistance to infection, TB infections are far more likely to progress to active disease as the immune system weakens, and although many were pointing out this connection in the mid-1980s, far too little was done to expand access to either TB or HIV medications. This inaction contributed to tens of millions of deaths from the intertwining pandemics of HIV and TB. In fact, between 1982, when the term AIDS was first used, and 2005, when HIV deaths in poor countries finally started to decline thanks to increased access to treatment, roughly as many Many people died of tuberculosis, as died in World War I and World War II combined. At a TV conference not long ago, I met a young South African woman named Fumeza Tissile, who was diagnosed with TB as a teenager. She just received a full scholarship to university, but from the start for freshman year, something felt off. She'd lost weight and was experiencing shortness of breath, eventually struggling just to walk up stairs. So I went to the clinic and coughed into a cup, she explained to me. Although we now have extremely accurate molecular tests for TB, they remain unnecessarily expensive. And so TB is still most commonly diagnosed via a person looking at a sputum sample through a microscope and trying to identify TB bacteria in that sample, which is exactly how Robert Koch diagnosed TB in 1882. Unfortunately, microscopy misses about 50% of positive cases, and Fumazza was told, catastrophically, that she was negative for TB. But she kept getting sicker. She had to drop out of school. Her weight dropped to 70 pounds. I was really struggling to breathe, she remembered. And then finally, she received a chest x-ray, whereupon it was obvious that tuberculosis was everywhere in her lungs. She started on a standard TB treatment immediately. Now, I have to take a little detour here to explain a protocol that's been around since the late 1970s called directly observed therapy short course. The thing to understand about dots is that it really only exists because of a lack of trust that certain patients will take their medications consistently. You might recall that TB is particularly susceptible to developing antibiotic resistance, which is worsened by haphazard treatment. So the idea behind DOTS is to have a healthcare professional directly observe patients taking their medicine every day. And in the beginning, this protocol did help because any regular access to adequate supplies of appropriate antibiotics was good news. But requiring patients to find their way to a clinic or doctor every day for months or else live in inpatient facilities to receive their daily medications creates extreme challenges for many people with TB. As Dr. Jennifer Furran put it to me, tuberculosis is the only disease I know where the core of therapy is based on fundamental mistrust. Now, it has long been argued that antibiotic resistance is driven by so-called patient non-compliance, which is to say patients failing to take their medication. And it is true that many TB patients fail to complete their full regimen. But the concept of compliance turns out to be really complicated when you zoom in to the level of individual patient experience. By the time she was finally diagnosed, Fumesa could not walk to the clinic by herself. She was simply too sick. And public transport was expensive not to mention the potential to spread the illness. Did her inability to access daily treatment make her non-compliant? Fortunately, Fumesa was able to avoid dots because South Africa had recently begun allowing seriously ill people to take home two weeks of treatment. But after two weeks, she had to return to the hospital for more medicine, and it was clear she was getting no better. Eventually, Fumesa was hospitalized, and after months of treatment, it was discovered that the drugs were failing because Fumesa had multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, also called MDR-TB. When she learned of her diagnosis, she told me, I was searching stuff online, and it was really, really scary to see because on Google, So many of the people on images were already dead. Their ribs were exposed, and I thought I was going to be like that too. I thought I was likely going to die. At this point, the only treatment regimen available to Fumazah involved painful injections and dozens of pills taken each day, and the injections came with a very high risk of permanent hearing loss. One day, as Fumesa put it, I just woke up and everything was quiet. As it turned out, Fumesa didn't have MDR-TB. Her particular strain of tuberculosis was resistant to even more drugs, making it pre-XDR-TB, or pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. The painful injection she received that caused permanent and total hearing loss for four years until she received a cochlear implant, that drug didn't help her at all. If Humaza had been able to access molecular testing, or if her TB had been correctly identified from the beginning, she could have been saved her hearing and so much suffering. Instead, she was in treatment for tuberculosis for three years and eight months, during which time she took between 20 and 30,000 pills before finally being cured. For many patients, this is still the reality in 2024, even though we now have treatment protocols that can cure patients with drug-resistant TB within just 6 to 9 months, with 5 to 7 pills per day. These drugs and protocols are only beginning to reach those who need them most. But each year, more people are accessing these better treatments, albeit belatedly. And that is due, in no small part, to Fumesa herself. Today she's a college graduate, a sociologist, and a leading voice in the fight against tuberculosis, whose efforts have helped increase access to life-saving drugs. But I ask you to act now. I ask you for change. Thank you. Badakwaleen, first released in rich countries in 2013, is a critical medication for treating drug-resistant tuberculosis, but for years the price had been artificially high due to a lack of competition. With support from the organization Doctors Without Borders, Fumeza and her friend Nandita Venkatesan filed a lawsuit in India to prevent the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson from extending its patent on the drug past its initial 2023 expiration date. Fumesa and Nandita succeeded in convincing Indian courts that J&J shouldn't have a forever patent on this critical drug, which eventually allowed for generic competition and far less expensive bedacoline. Experts estimate that over 50,000 people with MDR-TB will receive treatment every year, who otherwise would have had little, if any, chance of being cured. Many people with TB have survived because of Fumesa's work expanding access to diagnosis and treatment, and at the same time, she herself only survived because of activism and innovation that preceded her. Until quite recently, the World Health Organization's recommendations for people like Fumesa with drug-resistant TB was supportive care, which Dr. Carol Mitnick summarized to me as, put people in a hut by the side of the road and wait for them to die. But in the late 1990s, partners in health, known as Socios Unsalud in Peru, proved via a study that similar cure rates for MDR TB could be achieved in poor communities as were achieved at the world's finest hospitals. Still, many of the drugs that effectively treat highly resistant tuberculosis remain very expensive, not because they are made of gold or platinum or because we have to fly to the moon to find them. They are expensive because, one, prices are kept artificially high by pharmaceutical companies, and two, we are afraid that making these drugs less rare will lead to further antibiotic resistance. And listen, I understand the fear of antibiotic resistance. This isn't just about TB, the idea of a world where we cannot treat bacterial infections is indeed terrifying. But that should never mean that we reserve the most powerful and efficacious drugs for the rich. I would not accept my child being denied the best available treatment for TB. How can I ask Fu Meza's family to accept such a world? I asked a tuberculosis doctor, K.J. Sung, recently, of the 1.5 million people who will die of TB this year. How many would survive if they had access to the kind of healthcare afforded to the wealthy in the UK or Japan or the US? After all, while TB is often curable now, it remains a difficult disease to treat, especially in cases of extensive drug resistance. How many would die if everyone could access good healthcare? He asked me, as if confused by my question. Yeah, I said. None. Zero. Zero people should die of TB. We could choose to live in a world where no one dies of TB. That choice would require sacrifices. As most choices do, it would involve long-term, large-scale investments by rich countries to strengthen the healthcare systems of impoverished countries. And it would require the training and employment of far more healthcare workers and likely investments in new treatments. But we could choose that world. And instead, we choose this world. And that is why I would submit that TB in the 21st century is not really caused by a bacteria that we know how to kill. As Dr. A. Wilberforce-Williams correctly noted over a century ago, the real causes of TB are poverty, bad housing, bad sanitation, bad working conditions, long hours, high rent, and poor food. To put it another way, in the 21st century, the real cause of contemporary tuberculosis is, for lack of a better term, us. And that's bad news. But it is also good news. In 1800, there was nothing anyone could do to stop people from dying of TB. But we no longer live in that world, thanks to the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge about the illness and how to treat it. If we are the cause of TB, we can also be the solution to TB. And that's the challenge I want to leave you with. In 2000, around 2.3 million people died of tuberculosis. In 2021, 1.5 million did. In 2032, that number could decline by half or even more. Millions of lives can be saved in the next decade if we pressure our governments and other institutions to invest more in research and the global effort to provide curative therapy. We've done this successfully before thanks to the hard work of activists, researchers and healthcare workers, Access to HIV treatment has dramatically expanded in the last two decades. Malaria deaths have dropped precipitously. And I know, treating TB is complex. It has always been a strange disease. But it is curable. We can live in a world where no one dies of tuberculosis. We are the cause. But we can also be the cure. Thanks for watching our very first Crash Course Lecture series. Do you want to see Crash Course do more videos like this?

Despite significant medical advancements, including vaccines and antibiotics, tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death worldwide, surpassing fatalities from malaria, typhoid, and even war. This paradox highlights the deep-rooted societal issues that contribute to the disease's persistence, such as poverty, malnutrition, and inadequate healthcare access. Historically, tuberculosis has been known by various names, reflecting its devastating impact on individuals and communities. The disease not only reveals the vulnerabilities of human health but also underscores the inequalities in how it affects different populations. While anyone can contract TB, not everyone has the same risk of developing active disease or dying from it, often influenced by socio-economic factors. Understanding tuberculosis requires a historical perspective that acknowledges the interplay between disease and human experience. As we navigate the complexities of this ancient affliction, it becomes clear that addressing tuberculosis is not just a medical challenge but a societal imperative, demanding a holistic approach to health equity and disease prevention. Ultimately, tuberculosis serves as a lens through which we can examine broader themes of human existence, resilience, and the ongoing struggle against infectious diseases.", "channel": "CrashCourse"}

A to Z 3D Human Body Organ Systems", "domain": "medical", "duration": 3652, "transcript": "Hi, and welcome to Inside Us! In this video, we will talk about basic human anatomy and systems in human body. The human body can be studied and understood in terms of various systems, each of which is responsible for specific functions. Here are some of the major systems of the human body. Skeletal system. Muscular system. Cardiovascular system. Nervous system. Respiratory system digestive system urinary system endocrine system lymphatic system and reproductive system To understand how these systems work you first need to know a little bit about these systems Number one the skeletal system the skeletal system is the body system that provides structure and support for the body It consists of bones and joints, which work together to allow movement and protect internal organs. Bones are the hard, calcified tissues that make up the skeleton. They are classified into four types, long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones. Bones are connected to each other at joints, which allow movement. The skeletal system also plays a number of important roles in the body. It provides support and protection for internal organs, helps maintain posture and balance, and produces blood cells in the bone marrow. Number 2. The Muscular System The muscular system is the body system that is responsible for movement and the maintenance of posture. It consists of muscles, which are tissues that contract and relax to produce movement. There are three main types of muscles in the body. Skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, and smooth muscles. Muscles work in pairs, with one muscle contracting while the other relaxes. This allows for movement in various directions. Muscles also work together with bones and joints to maintain posture and balance. They help regulate blood pressure, produce heat, and store energy in the form of glycogen. They also protect against injury and help repair damaged tissue. Number 3. The Cardiovascular System. The Cardiovascular System is the body system that is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells and removing waste products from the body. It consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. Blood vessels are the tubes that carry blood throughout the body, and blood is the fluid that circulates through the body in the blood vessels. The cardiovascular system is essential for the functioning of the body. It ensures that all of the body's cells receive the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive and function properly. It also helps remove waste products and maintain a healthy balance of fluids in the body. 4. The Nervous System The nervous system is the body system that is responsible for the control and coordination of body functions. It consists of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. The brain is the control center of the nervous system. It receives and process information from the senses and sends out commands to the rest of the body. The spinal cord is a long, tube-like structure that runs from the brain down through the center of the back. It carries messages between the brain and the rest of the body. Nerves are the long, thin fibers that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord. They are made up of bundles of nerve cells called neurons and are found throughout the body. Number 5. The Respiratory System. The respiratory system is the body system that is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and the environment. It consists of the lungs, trachea, and other structures. The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system. They are located in the chest and are responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is a tube-like structure that runs from the back of the throat to the lungs. It is lined with tiny hairs called cilia, which help to filter out debris from the air. Other structures of the respiratory system include the bronchi and bronchioles, which are tubes that branch off from the trachea and carry air to the alveoli, and the diaphragm, which is a sheet of muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing. The respiratory system plays a vital role in maintaining the body's oxygen supply and removing waste products. Number 6. The digestive system. The digestive system is the body system that is responsible for breaking down food into nutrients that can be absorbed and used by the body. It consists of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The mouth is where food enters the body and where the process of digestion begins. The mouth contains teeth, which mechanically break down food, and the tongue, which helps to mix food with saliva. The esophagus is a tube-like structure that connects the mouth to the stomach. It uses muscle contractions called peristalsis to move food down to the stomach. The stomach is a muscular sac that mixes and grinds food with stomach acid and enzymes. The small intestine is a long, narrowed ube that is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption. The large intestine is a wider tube that absorbs water and electrolytes from undigested food and forms feces, which are then eliminated from the body through the rectum and anus. The digestive system is essential for the body's ability to obtain and use nutrients from food. It also helps to eliminate waste products from the body. Number 7. The urinary system. The urinary system, also known as the renal system, is the body system that is responsible for the filtering of waste products from the blood and the excretion of these products from the body. It consists of the kidneys, urethra, bladder, and urethra. The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located in the back of the abdomen. They are responsible for filtering waste products, such as urea and creatinine. The urethra are tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder is a muscular sac that stores urine until it is eliminated from the body through the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine out of the body. In addition to removing waste products, the urinary system helps to regulate the body's electrolyte balance and blood pressure, and plays a role in the production of red blood cells. 8. The endocrine system The endocrine system is the body system that is responsible for the production and secretion of hormones, which are chemical messengers that regulate various bodily functions. It consists of glands, such as the thyroid, pancreas, and adrenal glands, which produce hormones and release them into the bloodstream. The thyroid gland is located in the neck and produces hormones that regulate metabolism the body's process of converting food into energy. The pancreas is located behind the stomach and produces hormones, such as insulin, that help regulate blood sugar levels. The adrenal glands, which are located above the kidneys, produce hormones, such as adrenaline, that help the body respond to stress. The endocrine system helps to regulate metabolism, growth and development, and the body's response to stress and other stimuli. Number 9. The Lymphatic System. The lymphatic system is a body system that is responsible for the circulation of a clear fluid called lymph and the defense of the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of vessels, called lymph vessels, that carry lymph throughout the body, as well as a number of lymphoid organs and tissues, such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and tonsils, which help to filter and remove harmful substances from the lymph. Lymph is a clear fluid that contains white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help to fight infection and disease. The lymph nodes are small, being shaped organs that are located throughout the body and contain immune cells that help to fight infection. The spleen is an organ located in the abdomen that filters and removes old or damaged red blood cells and platelets from the blood. The tonsils are small masses of lymphoid tissue located in the back of the throat that help to filter and remove bacteria and other harmful substances from the air we breathe. The lymphatic system plays a vital role in the body's immune system and helps to protect the body against infection and disease. It also helps to maintain fluid balance in the body by returning excess fluid from the tissues back into the bloodstream. Number 10. The Reproductive System. The reproductive system is the body system that is responsible for the production and transportation of gametes' sex cells and the reproduction of offspring. In males, the reproductive system consists of the testes, which produce sperm, and the penis, which transports sperm during sexual intercourse. In females, the reproductive system consists of the ovaries, which produce eggs, and the uterus, which provides a place for a fertilized egg to develop into a baby. The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs located in the scrotum. They produce sperm and the hormone testosterone, which helps to regulate male secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair and a deeper voice. The penis is a male reproductive organ that is responsible for the transportation of sperm during sexual intercourse. It is made up of spongy tissue that becomes engodged with blood during sexual arousal, causing it to become erect. The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive organs located in the pelvis. They produce eggs and the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which help to regulate the menstrual cycle and female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and the appearance of body hair. The uterus is a female reproductive organ located in the pelvis. It is a muscular, pear-shaped organ that provides a place for a fertilized egg to develop into a baby. If fertilization does not occur, the uterus sheds its lining during menstruation. The reproductive system plays a vital role in the continuation of the human species. It allows for the production and transportation of gametes and the reproduction of offspring. In addition, hormones produced by the reproductive system play a role in the development and and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and the regulation of the menstrual cycle. The Skeletal System The skeletal system is the body system that provides structure and support for the body. It consists of bones and joints, which work together to allow movement and protect internal organs. Bones are the hard, calcified tissues that make up the skeleton. They are classified into four types, long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular Long bones are found in the arms, legs, and fingers. They have a long shaft with rounded ends called epiphyces. The epiphyces contain the growth plates also called epiphyzel plates, which are responsible for bone growth during development. Long bones provide support and leverage for movement. Examples of long bones include the femur, or the thigh bone, and tibia, or the shin bone. Short bones are found in the wrists and ankles. They are shorter and wider than long bones and provide stability and support. Examples of shirt bones include the carpals or the wrist bones and tarsals or the ankle bones. Flat bones are thin and flat with two parallel surfaces. They protect internal organs and provide a surface for muscle attachment. Examples of flat bones include the sternum or the breast bone and ribs. Irregular bones have complex shapes and serve a variety of functions. of irregular bones include the vertebrae or the spinal bones and hip bones. Bones are connected to each other at joints, which allow movement and help to maintain the body's posture and balance. There are three main types of joints. Sinarthroitic joints, Ampoarthroitic joints, and Diathroitic joints. Sinarthroitic joints, also called demovable joints, do not allow for any movement. They are found between bones that are tightly fused together, such as the bones of the skull Ampoarthrotic joints, also called slightly movable joints, allow for limited movement. They are found in bones that are connected by fibrous tissue, such as the vertebrae. Diathrotic joints, also called freely movable joints, allow for a wide range of movement. They are further classified into four main types. Ball and socket joints, such as the hip and shoulder joints, allow for a wide range of movement in multiple planes. Hinge joints, such as the elbow and knee joints, allow for movement in one plane, similar to the way a door hinges. Pivot joints, such as the joint between the first two cervical vertebrae, the atlas and axis, allow for rotational movement. Gliding joints, such as the joints between the carpal's wrist bones, allow for sliding movement. Joints are held together by a combination of bones, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Ligaments are strong, fibrous bands of connective tissue that connect bones to other bones. Tendons are fiber-scorched of connective tissue that connect muscles to bones. Muscles produce movement by contracting and relaxing, which causes movement at the joint. Joints can be affected by a number of conditions, such as arthritis, which is a group of conditions that cause inflammation and pain in the joints, and osteoporosis, which is a condition that causes bones to become weak and brittle. The skeletal system plays a number of important roles the body, including support. The skeletal system provides structural support for the body and helps to maintain posture and balance. Protection The skeletal system protects internal organs by surrounding and encasing them. For example, the rib cage protects the heart and lungs, and the skull protects the brain. Movement The skeletal system allows for movement through the action of muscles that are attached to the bones. Production of blood cells The bone marrow, which is the soft, spongy tissue inside the bones, is responsible for the production of red and white blood cells and platelets. Mineral storage. Bones act as a storage site for minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for the proper functioning of the body. Endocrine function. The skeletal system produces hormones, such as osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin, which play role in the regulation of metabolism and the immune system. Overall, the skeletal system plays a vital role in the health and function of the body. It provides structure and support, protects internal organs, allows for movement, and performs a number of important functions related to the production of blood cells and the storage of minerals. The Muscular System Without muscle, humans could not live. The primary job of muscle is to move the bones of the skeleton, but muscles also enable the heart to beat and constitute the walls of other important hollow organs. There are three types of muscle tissue. Skeletal muscle. This type of muscle creates movement in the body. There are more than 600 skeletal muscles, and they make up about 40% of a person's body weight. When the nervous system signals the muscle to contract, groups of muscles work together to move the skeleton. These signals and movements are nearly involuntary, yet they do require conscious effort. However, humans do not need to concentrate on individual muscles when moving. Skeletal muscle tissue is made up of a collection of muscle fibers wrapped in connective tissue sheets. There are three types of connective tissue sheets named for their location. Endomisium surrounds individual muscle fibers. It is made up of a delicate layer of reticular fibers and permits only small diameter nerve fibers and capillaries, thus acting as a site of metabolic exchange. Pyramuseum is a slightly thicker layer of connective tissue consisting mainly of typi and II-icolagen and surrounds a group of fibers. This fiber group is referred to as a fascicle or bundle. Fascicles are the functional units of skeletal muscle tissue. The pyramuseum contains slightly larger blood vessels and nerve fibers than those traveling through endomuseum. surrounds the entire collection of fascicles making up an individual muscle. This dense connective tissue made up of mainly type I collagen contains the neurovascular supply to the muscle. Cardiac Muscle Cardiac muscle is involuntary muscle. This type makes up the walls of the heart and creates the steady, rhythmic pulsing that pumps blood through the body from signals from the brain. This muscle type also creates the electrical impulses that produce the heart's contractions. And hormones and stimuli from the nervous system can also affect these impulses, such as when your heart rate increases when you're scared. It is capable of strong, continuous, and rhythmic contractions that are automatically generated. The contractility can be altered by the autonomic nervous system and hormones. In addition, this tissue type has high metabolic, energy, and vascular demands. Cardiac muscle fibers are long, branched cells, shaped like cylinders joined in to end, one or two nuclei located centrally. The fibers are separated by collagenous tissue that supports the capillary network of cardiac tissue. The myofilaments of cardiac muscle are arranged in a similar pattern to skeletal muscle, resulting in cross striations. The fibers are crossed by linear bands called intercalate discs. These structures have two important roles. Firstly, they provide attachment points that provides the tissue with a characteristic branched pattern. Secondly, they allow cardiac muscle tissue to function as a functional syncytium. Essentially, the contractile stimuli is propagated from one cell to the next one, resulting in a synchronous contraction of the entire tissue section. Smooth muscle. Smooth muscle makes up the walls of hollow organs, respiratory passageways, and blood vessels. Its wave-like movements propel things through the bodily system, such as food through your stomach or urine through your bladder. Like cardiac muscle, smooth muscle is involuntary and also contracts in response to stimuli and nerve impulses. Muscle movement happens when neurological signals produce electrical changes in muscle cells. During this process, calcium is released into the cells and brings about a short muscle twitch. Problems with the junction between the cells called a synapse can lead to neuromuscular diseases. Cardiovascular system, also known as the circulatory system, is a body system that is responsible for pumping and distributing blood throughout the body. It is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Heart. The heart is a muscular organ located in the chest that pumps blood throughout the body. It is about the size of a clenched fist and is located between the lungs, behind the breastbone. The heart has four chambers, the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. The right atrium is the upper chamber on the right side of the heart. It receives oxygen depleted blood from the body and pumps it into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. The right ventricle is the lower chamber on the right side of the heart. It pumps the oxygen depleted blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery to be oxygenated. The left atrium is the the upper chamber on the left side of the heart. It receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it into the left ventricle through the mitral valve. The left ventricle is the lower chamber on the left side of the heart. It pumps the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta, the main artery of the body. The heart has its own electrical conducting system, which helps to coordinate and regulate its contractions. The sine-ohatrial node, also known as the heart's natural pacemaker, sends out electrical impulses that cause the heart to contract and pump blood. The atrioventricular node receives the electrical impulses from the sine-ohatrial node and conducts them to the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood. The heart also has four valves that help to regulate the flow of blood through the chambers and prevent blood from flowing back into the wrong chambers. The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and right ventricle, and the mitral valve is located between the left atrium and left ventricle. The aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta, and the pulmonary valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Blood Vessels The blood vessels are tubes that carry blood throughout the body. There are three types of blood vessels, arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body's cells. They have thick walls and are able to withstand the high pressure of the blood being pumped from the heart. The aorta is the main artery of the body, and it branches off into smaller arteries that carry blood to the head, arms, legs, and other parts of the body. Vains are blood vessels that carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart. They have thinner walls than arteries and are not able to withstand as much pressure. The superior and inferior vena cava are the main veins of the body, and they carry blood from the head, arms, and upper body to the heart. The pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. They are only one cell thick, which allows for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products between the blood and the body's cells. There are thousands of miles of capillaries in the body, and they are found in almost every tissue and organ. Overall, the blood vessels play a vital role in the cardiovascular system, as they transport blood throughout the body and help to maintain the body's blood pressure. They also help to exchange nutrients, oxygen, and waste products between the blood and the body cells. Blood Blood is a vital fluid that circulates through the body's blood vessels and transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other substances to end from the cells. It also helps to maintain the body's pH balance and fights off infections and diseases. Blood is made up of red and white blood cells and platelets suspended in plasma. Red blood cells, or rithrocytes, are the most abundant type of blood cells. They contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen and carries it to the body's cells. Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow and have a lifespan of about 120 days. White blood cells, or leukocytes, are responsible for defending the body against infection and disease. There are several different types of white blood cells, including neutrophiles, monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow and have a lifespan of several days to a few months. Platelets or thrombocytes are small, irregularly shaped cells that are involved in blood clotting. When a blood vessel is damaged, platelets clump together to form a clot that helps to stop the bleeding. Platelets are produced in the bone marrow and have a lifespan of about 10 days. Plasma is the yellowish fluid component of blood that makes up about 55% of its volume. It is made up of water, proteins, nutrients, hormones, and other substances. Plasma helps to transport red and white blood cells and platelets throughout the body and plays a vital role in maintaining the body's blood pressure. Overall, blood plays a vital role in the body's overall health and well-being. It transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other substances to and from the cells and helps to maintain the body's pH balance. It also helps to defend the body against infection and disease and plays a role in blood clotting. Overall, the cardiovascular system plays a vital role in maintaining the body's overall health and well-being. It helps to oxygenate the body's cells, remove waste products, and transport nutrients, hormones, and other substances throughout the body. The Nervous System The nervous system is a complex network of tissues and organs that coordinate the functions of the body. It consists of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which consists of all the nerves that lie outside the central nervous system. Central Nervous System The central nervous system is the control center of the body. It consists of the brain and the spinal cord, and is responsible for processing and integrating sensory information, controlling movement, and coordinating the body's functions. The brain is a complex organ that is responsible for controlling all the body's functions, including thinking, feeling, and behaving. It is divided into several different regions, each with specific functions. The cerebrum is the largest and most complex part of the brain, and is responsible for most of the brain's functions. It is divided into two hemispheres left and right, which are connected by a bundle of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum. The cerebrum is divided into four main lobes, the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe. Each lobe is responsible for different functions, such as movement, sensation, language, and vision. The cerebellum is located beneath the cerebrum and is responsible for coordinating movement and balance. The brainstem is located between the cerebrum and the spinal cord and is responsible for controlling many of the body's automatic functions such as heart rate, breathing, and digestion. It is also involved in the control of sleep, wakefulness, and consciousness. The hippocampus is located within the brain and is responsible for forming and storing memories. The amygdala is also located within the brain and is involved in the processing of emotions and the formation of memories. Spinal cord The spinal cord is a long, slender tube of nerve tissue that runs from the brain down through the center of the back. It carries messages between the brain and the rest of the body and helps coordinate movement. It is protected by the vertebrae of the spine, which form a hollow tube around it. The spinal cord is divided into different regions, each with specific functions. The brain sends signals down the spinal cord to control the body's movements and functions, and the spinal cord sends sensory information back to the brain. The spinal cord is made up of nerve cells' neurons and supportive cells' glial cells. The neurons are responsible for carrying messages to and from the brain, while the glial cells provide support and protection for the neurons. Peripheral Nervous System The peripheral nervous system is one of the two components that make up the nervous system of human body. It consists of nerves and ganglia, which lie outside the brain and the spinal cord. The main function of the peripheral nervous system is to connect the central nervous system to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system can be divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system. The somatic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system responsible for carrying sensory and motor information to and from the central nervous system. The somatic system is responsible for transmitting sensory information as well as for controlling voluntary movement. This system contains two major types of neurons. Motor neurons, also called efferent neurons. Motor neurons Neurons carry information from the brain and spinal cord to muscle fibers throughout the body. These motor neurons allow us to take physical action in response to stimuli in the environment. Sensory Neurons Also called afferent neurons, sensory neurons carry information from the nerves to the central nervous system. The sensory neurons allow us to take in sensory information and send it to the brain and spinal cord. The autonomic nervous system The autonomic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that's responsible for regulating involuntary body functions, such as blood flow, heartbeat, digestion, and breathing. In other words, it is the autonomic system that controls aspects of the body that are usually not under voluntary control. This system allows these functions to take place without needing to consciously think about them happening. The autonomic system is further divided into two branches. system. By regulating the flight or fight response, the sympathetic system prepares the body to expend energy to respond to environmental threats. When action is needed, the sympathetic system triggers a response by accelerating heart rate, increasing breathing rate, boosting blood flow to muscles, activating sweat secretion, and dilating the pupils. Parasympathetic system. This helps maintain normal body functions and conserve physical resources. Once a threat has passed, this system will slow the heart rate, slow breathing, reduce blood flow to muscles, and constrict the pupils. This allows the body to return to a normal resting state. The Respiratory System The Respiratory System is a group of organs responsible for taking in oxygen, eliminating carbon dioxide, and maintaining proper pH balance in the body. It consists of the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Nasal Cavity The nasal cavity is a hollow space in the head that is located above and behind the nose. It is lined with a moist, thin membrane called the mucosa, which is rich in blood vessels and contains tiny hair-like structures called cilia. These cilia help to filter out dirt and other particles that may be inhaled. The nasal cavity has several functions. It warms and moistens the air that is breathed in, which helps to keep the respiratory tract moist and prevents the mucosa from drying out. It also filters the air, removing dust, pollen, and other particles that may be harmful to the body. The nasal cavity is lined with tiny hair-like structures called cilia that help to sweep these particles out of the airway and prevent them from entering the lungs. The nasal cavity also helps to detect odors. It contains small, sensitive cells called olfactory neurons, which are responsible for detecting and identifying different smells. When an odorant molecule is inhaled, it binds to receptors on the olfactory neurons, triggering a response that is sent to the brain. The brain then interprets the signal as a specific smell. Farynx The pharynx, also known as the throat, is a muscular tube that extends from the base of the skull to the esophagus and larynx. It serves as a common passageway for bullfair and food and plays a vital role in the respiratory and digestive systems. The pharynx is divided into three regions. The nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. The nasopharynx is the upper part of the pharynx that is located behind the nasal cavity. It is separated from the nasal cavity by the soft palate, which is a muscular structure that moves up and down to close off the nasal cavity when we swallow. The oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx and is located behind the mouth. The larynx-gopherarynx is the lower part of the pharynx and is located behind the larynx. The pharynx is lined with a mucous membrane that helps to moisten and protect the tissues. It contains several small muscles that help to move food and liquids from the mouth to the esophagus and to prevent them from entering the respiratory system. The pharynx also contains the tonsils, which are small, round masses of lymphoid tissue that help to defend the body against infection. The pharynx also plays a role in speech, as the sound waves that are produced by the larynx boss through it on their way out of the body. Larynx The larynx, also known as the voice box, is a muscular organ located at the top of the trachea or the windpipe. It is responsible for producing sound, protecting the trachea from foreign objects, and regulating the flow of air to end from the lungs. The larynx contains the vocal cords, which are two bands of elastic tissue that stretch across the larynx and vibrate when air passes through them. The vibrations of the vocal cords produce sound waves, which are then modified by the surrounding structures of the larynx such as the tongue, lips, and teeth to produce speech. The pitch of the sound produced by the vocal cords depends on their tension and thickness. The larynx also contains the epiglottis, a flap of cartilage that covers the opening to the trachea when we swallow. This helps to prevent food and liquids from entering the airway and lungs. The larynx also has a series of small muscles that help to open and close the opening to the trachea called the glottis and to control the flow of air. In addition to its role in speech and protection of the airway, the larynx also plays a role in maintaining the proper pH balance in the body. It does this by controlling the rate of respiration, which is the process of exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body. Trachea The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is a tube-like structure that extends from the larynx voice box to the bronchi in the lungs. It is composed of rings of cartilage that help to keep the trachea open and prevent it from collapsing. The trachea is lined with a mucous membrane that helps to moisten and protect the tissues. It is also lined with small hair-like structures called cilia that help to sweep mucus and other debris out of the airway. The trachea is about 4 inches long and about 1 inch in diameter. It is divided into two main branches, called the bronchi, which lead to the right and left lungs. The trachea and bronchi are part of the respiratory system and are responsible for carrying air to and from the lungs. Bronchi The bronchi are the two main air tubes that branch off the trachea and lead to the lungs. Each bronchus enters a lung and divides into smaller tubes called bronchioles, which in turn divide into even smaller tubes called alveoli. The bronchi and bronchioles make up the bronchiol tree, which is responsible for distributing air to the alveoli. The bronchi are lined with a mucous membrane that helps to moisten and protect the tissues. They also contain tiny hair-like structures called cilia and mucus-producing cells that help to filter out dirt and other particles that may be inhaled. The cilia and mucus work together to sweep these particles out of the bronchi and prevent them from entering the lungs. The bronchi also contain small muscles that help to control the flow of air to and from the lungs. During inhalation, the muscles in the bronchi relax and the walls of the bronchi expand, allowing air to flow in. Exhalation, the muscles in the bronchi contract and the walls of the bronchi narrow, forcing air out of the lungs. The Digestive System The digestive system is a group of organs that work together to convert food into energy and basic nutrients to feed the entire body. Food is broken down mechanically and chemically in the mouth, then moves through the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine before being eliminated from the body. The organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas also play important roles in the digestive process. Mouth The mouth plays a vital role in the digestive system as it is the first point of contact between the body and food. The process of digestion begins in the mouth with the mechanical breakdown of food through the process of chewing. Food is mixed with saliva, which contains the enzyme amylase, responsible for breaking down carbohydrates. The tongue helps to mix the food with saliva and also helps in moving the food to the back of the mouth for swallowing. The act of swallowing, also known as deglutition, is a complex process that is controlled by several muscles in the mouth, throat, and esophagus. In addition to breaking down food, the mouth also plays a role in the sense of taste, which helps the body to identify and discern between different types of food. Esophagus The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. It is responsible for transporting food from the mouth to the stomach using a series of muscular contractions, known as peristalsis. The esophagus also has a ring-like muscle at the top, known as the upper esophageal sphincter, which helps to keep food and stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus. This muscle relaxes to allow food to pass through and then tightens to prevent the backflow of stomach contents. The esophagus also has a lower esophageal sphincter, which is located at the bottom and separates the esophagus from the stomach. Stomach The stomach is a muscular sac that plays a crucial role in the digestion of food. It mixes food with stomach acid and digestive enzymes, which helps to break down proteins and kill harmful bacteria. The stomach also releases a hormone called ghrelin, which signals to the brain that the body is hungry. As food enters the stomach, it is mixed with stomach acid and enzymes to form a thick liquid called chym. The stomach then releases the chym into the small intestine in small amounts, allowing for proper digestion and absorption. The stomach is able to stretch to accommodate large amounts of food and also has the ability to temporarily store food, releasing it into the small intestine as needed. Small Intestine The small intestine is a long, coiled tube that is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption. The walls of the small intestine are lined with tiny, finger-like projections called villi and microvilli, which greatly increases the surface area for absorption. The small intestine also plays a role in the secretion of bile, which is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile helps to emulsify fats, making them easier to digest. The small intestine also receives enzymes from the pancreas, which aid in the digestion of proteins and fats. Large intestine The large intestine is a tube-like organ that is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from undigested food. It also plays a role in the formation of feces, which is eliminated from from the body through the rectum and anus. The large intestine also houses beneficial bacteria, which aid in the breakdown of undigested food and produce certain vitamins. Rectum. The rectum is the last section of the large intestine and plays a key role in the elimination of waste from the body. It is a muscular tube that temporarily stores feces before they are eliminated through the anus. The rectum also plays a role in the process of defecation, which is the act of passing feces from the body. The rectum is sensitive to the presence of feces and sends signals to the brain indicating that a bowel movement is needed. The rectum also has a muscle called the rectal sphincter which controls the release of feces. It is important to note that the rectum can also store gas and have to release it by the anus. Anus. The anus is the opening at the end of the digestive tract through which feces are eliminated from the body. It is made up of several muscles, including the external and internal anal sphincters, which control the release of feces. The external anal sphincter is under conscious control, while the internal anal sphincter is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The anus also has a rich blood supply, which helps to protect against injury and infection. It is important to note that the anus is also a sensitive organ, as it contains a large number of nerve endings. The urinary system, the urinary system, also known as the renal system, is responsible for filtering the blood, removing waste products, and regulating the body's fluid balance. The main organs of the urinary system include the kidneys, urethas, bladder, and urethra. Kidneys The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located in the upper abdomen, on either side of the spine. They are responsible for filtering the blood and removing waste products, such as urea and creatinine, from the body. The kidneys also help to regulate the body's electrolyte balance, such as sodium and potassium, and blood pressure. They also produce hormones that regulate red blood cell production and promote bone health. The kidneys filter the blood through small structures called nephrons, which remove waste products and excess water from the blood to form urine. The urine then flows through the renal pelvis, which is the funnel-like structure at the center of each kidney and into the urethas. Urethas The urethas are a pair of thin, muscular tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The urethas use a series of muscular contractions, called peristalsis, to move urine through the urinary tract. The urethas also have a valve-like structure at the junction with the bladder, called the the ureter of vesicle junction, which prevents urine from flowing back into the kidneys. Bladder The bladder is a muscular sac located in the lower abdomen that stores urine until it is eliminated from the body. The walls of the bladder are composed of smooth muscle, which allows the bladder to expand as it fills with urine. The bladder also has a muscle called the urinary sphincter, which controls the release of urine. The bladder can stretch and hold up to 400-600 milliliters of urine before the person feels the urge to urinate. Urethra The urethra is a tube-like structure that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. In males, the urethra is longer, approximately 20 centimeters in length, and also carries semen during ejaculation. In females, the urethra is shorter, approximately 4 centimeters in length, and located closer to the clitoris and vaginal opening. The urethra is lined with mucous membrane and has a rich blood supply, which helps to prevent infection and injury. The endocrine system. The endocrine system is a complex network of glands and hormones that regulate various bodily functions, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. The endocrine system works closely with the nervous system to help the body respond to changes in the environment. Petuitary gland. The Petuitary gland, also known as the master gland, is located at the base of the brain and plays a key role in regulating the endocrine system. It produces several hormones, including growth hormone, which stimulates growth and cell reproduction, prolactin, which stimulates milk production in females, thyroid stimulating hormone, which regulates the thyroid gland, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, which regulates the adrenal glands. Thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located in the neck and produces hormones that regulate metabolism, including TRE-Duthyronin-ET3 and Thyroxine-D4. These hormones help to control the body's energy use and heat production. The thyroid gland also produces calcitonin, which helps to regulate calcium levels in the blood. Parathyroid gland. The parathyroid gland is located near the thyroid gland and produces a parathyroid hormone, which helps to regulate calcium levels in the blood. PTH works in opposition to calcidonin, stimulating the release of calcium from bone tissue and the absorption of calcium in the kidneys and intestines. Adrenal glands The adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney and produce a variety of hormones, including adrenaline and noradrenaline, which which help to regulate the body's fight or flight response to stress. The adrenal glands also produce hormones that regulate the body's metabolism, such as cortisol, which helps to regulate blood sugar levels and the body's response to stress. And aldosterone, which helps to regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure. Pancreas The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach that produces hormones such as insulin and glucagon, which help to regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose in cells, while glucagon promotes the breakdown of stored glycogen to glucose. The pancreas also produces digestive enzymes that date in the digestion of food in the small intestine. Overys and Testes The ovaries and testes are the primary reproductive organs and produce hormones that regulate the body's reproductive functions. In females, The ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. In males, the testes produce testosterone, which regulates the development of male secondary sexual characteristics and sperm production. Pineal gland The pineal gland is a small endocrine gland located in the brain that produces the hormone melatonin, which helps to regulate the body's sleep wake cycle. Thymus The thymus is a small gland located in the chest that produces hormones that play a role in the immune system, such as thymicin and thymic hormones, which help to regulate the development and function of T lymphocytes, which are basically white blood cells that play a role in the immune response. All these hormones produced by the glands of the endocrine system work together in a complex network to regulate various bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Hormones produced by the endocrine system travel through the bloodstream to reach their target cells or organs, where they bind to specific receptors and trigger a response. In addition to the hormones produced by the glands of the endocrine system, other hormones such as those produced by the hypothalamus and the pancreas also play a critical role in regulating various bodily functions. For example, the hypothalamus produces hormones that regulate the release of hormones from the pituitary gland and controls functions such as hunger, thirst, and body temperature. It's important to note that imbalances or dysfunction of the endocrine system can lead to various health conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disorders, and hormonal cancers. Regular checkups and screenings can help to detect and manage these conditions early on. The lymphatic system The lymphatic system is a crucial part of the body's immune system and helps to protect the body against disease and infection. It is a network of vessels, organs, and tissues that help to remove waste and toxins from the body, as well as playing a crucial role in the immune system. Lymph Vessels The lymph vessels are a network of thin walled vessels that run parallel to the circulatory system. They transport a clear, watery fluid called lymph, which contains immune cells and waste products from the body's tissues. The lymph vessels have one-way valves that help to prevent the backflow of lymph and rely on muscle contractions and breathing to move the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also pick up excess fluids, proteins, and other materials that leak out of the blood vessels and return them back to the bloodstream. Lymph Nodes The lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures located throughout the body, particularly in the neck, armpit, groin, and abdomen. They act as filters for the lymph, trapping any foreign substances such as bacteria or cancer cells. The immune cells in the lymph nodes then work to destroy these harmful substances. The lymph nodes also have a rich blood supply, which helps to nourish and support the immune cells. Splen. The spleen is an organ located in the upper left abdomen that acts as a filter for the blood, similar to the lymph nodes. It also plays a role in the production and storage of white blood cells, particularly lymphocytes and monocytes. The spleen also helps to remove old or damaged red blood cells and platelets from the circulation. Thymus The thymus is a gland located in the chest that is responsible for the production and maturation of a type of white blood cells called telymphocytes, which play a crucial role in the immune response. T-cells, also called T-cells, are a type of white blood cells that are crucial for the immune response. They are produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus. Tonsils The tonsils are clusters of lymphoid tissue located in the back of the throat and help to protect against inhaled foreign substances. Tonsils also produce lymphocytes that help to identify and fight off invading microorganisms. mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, MALT. MALT are small clusters of lymphoid tissue found in various mucous membranes throughout the body, such as the respiratory and digestive tracts, which also help to protect against inhaled and ingested foreign substances. MALT are important part of the immune system. They are found in the mucous membrane, which lines the body's internal cavities and surfaces that communicate with the environment, such as the respiratory and digestive tracts. The lymphatic system also plays a crucial role in the immune response by producing, transporting, and housing white blood cells, such as lymphocytes and monocytes, which help to fight against invading microorganisms and foreign substances. Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, are produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. These cells are responsible for recognizing and responding to foreign invaders in the body, such as viruses and bacteria. Another important function of the lymphatic system is to maintain fluid balance in the body by returning excess fluid and proteins from the tissues back into the circulatory system. This helps to prevent the buildup of fluids in the tissues and helps to keep blood pressure and fluid balance at normal levels. It is important to note that disorders of the lymphatic system such as lymphdema, which is swelling caused by a buildup of lymph in the tissues, and lymphoma, which is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, can occur. Lymphdema can occur due to injury, surgery, radiation therapy, or congenital defects that affect the lymphatic vessels. It can cause swelling in the limbs, face, or other parts of the body. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which can affect the lymph nodes, spleen, and other organs. Symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. The lymphatic system also plays a critical role in the body's response to inflammation, which is a natural response to injury or infection. Inflammation occurs when the immune cells in the lymphatic system respond to harmful stimuli such as pathogens or damaged cells. The immune cells release chemicals that cause the blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the affected area, and bringing in more immune cells to help fight the infection. In addition to its role in the immune system and fluid balance, the lymphatic system also plays a crucial role in the body's fat metabolism. It helps to transport fats from the small intestine to the bloodstream where they can be used as energy or stored. Overall, the lymphatic system is a vital part of the body's overall health and well-being. It helps to protect the body against disease and infection, maintain fluid balance, and play a role in the body's immune response, fat metabolism, and other important functions. It is important to take care of the lymphatic system by maintaining a healthy diet, staying active and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. It's also important to have regular checkups and screenings to detect any possible disorders or diseases of the lymphatic system as early as possible. In addition to traditional medical treatments, there are also alternative therapies such as manual lymphatic drainage massage, compression therapy, and exercise programs specifically designed for individuals with lymph damma. MLD massage is a gentle, rhythmic massage technique that helps to stimulate the flow of lymph, reduce swelling, and improve the function of the affected limb. Compression therapy, using specially designed compression garments, helps to reduce swelling and improve the circulation of lymph. It is also important to take care of the lymphatic system by avoiding activities that may cause damage to the lymphatic vessels, such as extreme heat, sunburns, and insect bites. It's also important to avoid activities that may cause injury or damage to the lymph nodes, such as excessive alcohol consumption and smoking. Overall, the lymphatic system is a complex and vital part of the body that plays a crucial role the body's overall health and well-being. It is important to take care of the lymphatic system by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, staying active, and having regular checkups to ensure its proper functioning. The Reproductive System The reproductive system is the body system that is responsible for the production and transportation of gametes' sex cells and the reproduction of offspring. In males, the reproductive system consists of the testes, which produce sperm, and the penis which transports sperm during sexual intercourse. In females, the reproductive system consists of the ovaries, which produce eggs, and the uterus, which provides a place for a fertilized egg to develop into a baby. The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs located in the scrotum. They produce sperm and the hormone testosterone, which helps to regulate male secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair and a deeper voice. The penis is a male reproductive organ that is responsible for the transportation of sperm during sexual intercourse. It is made up of spongy tissue that becomes engodged with blood during sexual arousal, causing it to become erect. The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive organs located in the pelvis. They produce eggs and the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which help to regulate the menstrual cycle and female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and the appearance of body hair. The uterus is a female reproductive organ located in the pelvis. It is a muscular, pear-shaped organ that provides a place for a fertilized egg to develop into a baby. If fertilization does not occur, the uterus sheds its lining during menstruation. The reproductive system plays a vital role in the continuation of the human species. It allows for the production and transportation of gametes and the reproduction of offspring. In addition, hormones produced by the reproductive system play a role in the development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and the regulation of the menstrual cycle. Integumentary system. The integumentary system is the body's largest organ and is made up of the skin, hair, nails, and glands. It plays a vital role in protecting the body from the outside environment, regulating temperature and sensing touch, pressure, and pain. Skin The skin is the body's largest organ and is made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis is the outermost layer and is composed of dead skin cells that provide a barrier against the outside environment. The epidermis also contains various specialized cells such as melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, and Langerhans cells, which play a role in the immune response. The dermis is the middle layer and contains blood vessels, nerves, and hair follicles. The dermis also contains various structures such as sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and hair follicles. The subcutaneous tissue is the innermost layer and is made up of fat and connective tissue. The subcutaneous tissue helps to insulate the body, store energy, and also contains blood vessels and nerves. Hair Hair is made up of dead caroteneized cells and is found all over the body, with the exception of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Hair provides insulation and protects the skin from UV radiation and physical damage. Each hair follicle contains a small bundle of muscles that can contract to cause goose bumps. Nails Nails are made up of caroteneized cells and protect the tips of the fingers and toes. They also aid in grasping and manipulating objects. Nails are formed in the matrix, which is the base of the nail, and are pushed forward as new cells form. The nails are composed of several layers of hard, compacted keratin, a protein that makes up hair and other parts of the body. Nails also have a pink color due to the presence of blood vessels in the underlying skin. Glans The integumentary system also includes various glands, such as sweat and oil glands, which help to regulate body temperature and moisturize the skin. The sweat glands produce sweat, which cools the body through evaporating. Sweat contains water, salt, and other waste products. The oil glands produce sebum, which moisturizes the skin and hair. Sebum is an oily substance that helps to keep the skin and hair soft and supple. Sensory Receptors The integumentary system also contains various sensory receptors, such as miracle cells, mysner corpuscles, poachini and corpuscles, and freener vandinks, which help to sense touch, pressure, and pain. These receptors are located in the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin and send signals to the brain through the nervous system. In addition to its functions, the integumentary system also plays a role in the body's immune response by protecting against invading microorganisms and alerting the immune system to the presence of foreign substances. The skin also plays a role in vitamin D production, which is essential for bone health. It's important to take care of the integumentary system by maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and protecting the skin from excessives on exposure and other environmental factors that can cause damage. Regular checkups and screenings can help to detect any disorders or diseases of the integumentary system as early as possible. Overall, the integumentary system is a complex and vital part of the body that plays a crucial role in protecting the body from the outside environment, regulating temperature, and sensing touch, pressure, and pain. It also plays a role in the body's immune response, vitamin E production, and other important functions. It is important to take care of the integumentary system by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and regular checkups to ensure proper function. That's it for today. Hope you liked this video.

By the time I graduated medical school, there are a lot of things that I wish I had done very differently and they would have made med school much easier or saved me a lot of time and stress. And so let me tell you the mistakes that I made. I'll tell you what I did, what problems it led to, which weren't like that obvious at the time and then what I would do differently or how I managed to change things up by the time I graduated. Hopefully it can save you some of the stress that I went through going through medical school myself. For those of you that are new to the channel, welcome. I'm Dr Justin Song. I'm a learning coach and the head of learning at IcanStudy, but in my past life I worked as a junior doctor for a couple of years before deciding that my true passion and alignment lay with education and educational entrepreneurship and social enterprise. And so that's what I do now. So for the last 10 years, I have been helping students from around the world learn to learn more efficiently. Let's just jump into it with the first mistake that I made, which was that I really over-engineered a way of learning that was suited for exams. And this was fine in my pre-clinical years, and when I entered into my clinical attachments in hospitals, which for me was in my third year of medical school, I actually failed my first run. That first one was general medicine, or for those of you in North America, internal medicine, which you probably know is like a major, major attachment. And this came as a shock to me because I was doing reasonably well in my preclinical examinations. So I didn't really expect to bomb so hard in my clinical attachment. And the reason was because I was learning in a way that was fine for the exam, but it wasn't translating very well to clinical placement and the way that I would need to use that knowledge in real life. And so not only could I not really use my knowledge effectively, but also I'd built a system that was really more around short-term memory like learn it for this exam and then a month or two later I don't really need it anymore so I wasn't creating strategies that allowed me to build foundational knowledge and carry that through year after year so what ended up happening was that I would probably every single year of not only medicine but also working as a doctor relearn the same things that I'd learned and just kept forgetting over and over and over again so that was probably one One of the biggest mistakes that I made was just over learning for exams without having more foresight into how I would need to use that information in the future. But another aspect of it was that I wasn't very discerning about the level of detail that I needed. I had a general sense that I needed to learn everything and I was very focused on a lot of very specific details. So I would have fragmented, discrete, but like a copious amount of factually accurate technical specific information and detail, but when it came to really understanding how everything worked at a big picture level I was very disjointed. It was very fragmented So when I started seeing patients that didn't just have like this disease with this particular symptom cluster and they had atypical presentations of a disease and they were slightly older and they were on this medication and a previous comorbidity and they had this type of surgery and they also have this other disease and they've got this other thing which maybe is diagnosed or maybe not but you don't know because the record was from 20 years ago. It just became way too confusing because I didn't know how all these different aspects interacted with each other to affect the presentation of the patient in front of me or the management for them moving forward. And I'd look at my seniors and they used to be able to like take all these things and just come to these very nuanced, really well synthesized management plans and differential diagnoses for the patients very quickly. And it became obvious to me that it wasn't just because they had memorized more than me. They fundamentally were able to see the patient and all that information through a different lens. Like it made sense to them in a way that it just did not make sense to me. That was not about just knowing more facts. I never really thought about how you can understand information in a different way through preclinical. When I was in preclinical, there was a method of understanding a topic that was given to me. Like this is how you learn antibiotics. This is how you learn, you know, microbiology. This is how you learn genetics. This is how you learn anatomy, whatever it is. And that is the way that I would learn it. The way it was given to me is the way that I'd learn it. And if it was hard to understand, it's just like, I guess this is kind of a harder topic. I just need to study more. I didn't go out of my way very often to look for a simpler way to put it all together. As a proportion of time wasted, this probably wasted the most amount of time for me throughout all of medical school, which was that I didn't utilize my clinical attachment days very effectively. There were a lot of days where I'd rock up and I wasn't really interested in what was happening during the war round. I wasn't interested in what was happening during the patients. Like I didn't really even want to see patients because I felt like I had such a knowledge deficit that I just wanted to go and study. Like I would come to the hospital just to show face, show my seniors like, hey, I'm around, I exist, please remember me for when you do my marking forms. Hey, by the way, can I go and just study now? And thinking back on it, it is important to take time independently to study, but there's also a lot of learning that I could have gained from clinical placements that I just completely ignored. There are just some things that you cannot learn from just studying. And you need the patient there to be able to understand what you're learning in context, to give it relevance. And that's what I found was that when I was studying it purely academically, I didn't have a sense of relevance for how I could use this information and all the nuances around it. And so it was very hard for me to make sense of it and organize it because I just didn't know how I'd need to apply it. At the end of this video, I also talk about how you can make the most of clinical time. This is what I recommend to all my clinical medical students. this is what I started doing in my final year of medical school and it just makes clinical days so much more valuable Okay, so let me give you a couple of examples now specifically of things that I've learned like this wrong way and the way that I changed it So that you've got a bit more context and I'll end off with like a few specific concrete recommendations that I would recommend for any medical student. I Promise you this is gonna make your medical school life much easier much more enjoyable and just like you're gonna save a lot of time. So here's what happened. I was sitting there in the ward and my consultant, otherwise known as an attending physician, he sat down after I saw a patient and he said, okay, your patient here has chest pain. What are you thinking about? And I said, okay, well, there are some things it could be like it could be an MI, Malkyrie infarction, it could also be a PE and I just could not think like I was clawing for ideas for chest pain, which is like It's like the most typical, like the most classical, you know, symptom that you should probably be prepared for. And it's when I realized I've never really thought about it from that perspective before. Like I had thought about it from such a disease focus that I've never really thought about it from a symptom focus. When someone just presents to you with whatever they have, how can I navigate backwards to figure out what disease or diseases are going to sit in my differentials? And I just couldn't use my knowledge in that direction. It was just too fixed. was just too rigid. And this came up time and time again. It happened for diabetes, it happened for shock. Because the way that I learned something like diabetes was that I learned it like this. Right? I'd learn, okay, this is diabetes, this is pacifist, these are the complications. And whenever I tested myself, I test myself like this as well. Hey, what are the microvascular complications of diabetes? What are the macrovascular complications of diabetes? I didn't test myself from the other way around. I didn't say, okay, let's say that someone has blindness in their eyes. What are the differential diagnoses for that? what are the possible things and what are the questions that you would have to ask to rule in or rule out certain diagnoses. The clinical reasoning part of my studying, I just did not think about it until way too late in my medical school. And a lot of medical schools now have realized that that's a problem with the way that they teach. And so there are these things, they're technically called spiraled curriculums or spiral integrated curriculums or integrated curriculums. But the idea is that you have a lot of this clinical scenario thinking all the way from the beginning in your preclinical years, which is a great step. But I also work with a lot of students that are going to medical schools where they teach it this way now. And what I've realized is that they still compartmentalize it. They still learn every disease as a disease basis first and then way, way, way, way down the line, they then try to go backwards. And then they get overwhelmed and overloaded and because medical school is challenging and there's a lot of volume to study, it's just too much and people just end up more confused. And so one of the things that I wish I had done and then I started doing later on is I just studied it purely from the clinical's perspective first. I learned it from a clinical reasoning perspective to begin with and then later when I understood that I'd come back to the pathophysiology and then reinforce my learning at a disease focus because that actually makes a lot more sense. Rather than learning the disease one by one and then trying to bring it together to see how you can look at it from a symptom first perspective, I just learned it from a symptom and sign perspective first and then I worked my way through the differentials and then padded up with pathophysiology. So if someone comes in with chest pain I would start thinking okay pain in the chest could come from the skin could come from the bones could come from the muscles I just work my way in could be the pleura could be the myocardium could be neurogenic so I would start in that order and then I think okay so what are the things that I can think of that could be affecting things there. And anytime I didn't understand why I thought I was missing something, then I would go to learn more about that particular disease so that I would be able to work through my differential and clinical reasoning process a little bit more. What this meant was that my knowledge was much more functionally organized to begin with. And I had the same level of detail, but I had much more context to it. And a great example of where this came in handy was when than I learned about shock. So when I first learned shock in preclin, I learned it pretty much like this. I just had all the different types of shock, all the different possible etiologies, the pathophysiologies and all the various clinical findings like cardiac output is down or up or JVP is elevated or not or neutral or in a post and heart rate. Like I would just learn all of these different things and I'd have these committed to flashcards. Actually, you know what? I literally, for this particular topic, I literally drew handwritten cards and blue-tacked them to my wall. And I was so proud because they were very pretty and I literally got no value out of it. I probably looked at them like five times and I never really remembered anything about them to this day. I don't remember what it looks like. Other than the fact that I used to hang right above the door handle on my wall. So this is how I learned shock and I managed to pass all my exams. If you asked me, hey, what are all the symptoms of hypervillemic shock? What are all the signs? I would have been able to give you an answer. Honestly, I don't remember anymore. But when I worked in ED, my senior pulled me aside and he was like, hey, let's just talk about shock for a second. He was like, you know, I know that when you go through med school, you learn it this way, but let me show you a way that's just much faster. So he takes a piece of just random clinical paper and he just draws a very simple diagram and he just says, hey, look. At the end of the day, shock is just about a pump, the tubes that are connected to the pump, sitting inside a container that is your body, and then there's fluid being pumped through the tubes. So if you've got shock, it's either going to be a problem with the pump, a problem with the tubes, a problem with the container, or a problem with the fluid. And that's all the different types of shocks. And then he went through and then he mapped every single part of shock and all the different types and ideologies to this framework. And he said, so when you're seeing a patient, all you need to do is ask yourself, is there a problem with the pumps? And you know exactly what questions to ask is a problem with the pipes, you know, the questions to ask is a problem with the fluid, you know, the questions to ask is a problem with the container, you know, the questions to ask. And for me, that was a transformative way of thinking. One of the things that I said before was that I didn't spend a lot of time when I was studying academically to deliberately make things simpler and here's the reason why it would have helped me a lot because just looking for like an image for this video I actually found that there are a lot of other ways that I'm thinking about shock and I found this particular image here which classifies shock in a very similar very simple way and I don't know when this was published but if I had taken the time to deliberately take something that I thought was overwhelming and very detailed and say there must be a simpler more intuitive way to understand this. What could it be? If I had taken the time, 10, 15, 20 minutes to take this information and deliberately try to make it simpler and more intuitive, I probably could have arrived at this kind of conclusion by myself years earlier. But I didn't and as a result, I had a gap in my knowledge and I wish I had done that for anatomy as well. I re-studied anatomy again and again and again almost every single year and it's only when I actually did a run in orthopedics that it kind of clicked how I needed to be thinking about it and it clicked for me during surgery. I was retracting a body cavity as you do, just trying to maintain tension and not have the consultant surgeon yell at me we've all been there and also not trying to fall asleep. It's a long operation. It's like a four and a half hour operation just standing there almost falling asleep passing out and after the operation He comes out to me and he says So what did you learn and to be honest? I learned that I hate retracting body cavities So I didn't really learn anything and I tried to make something up like oh, it's really interesting seeing how you did the suture It was cool to see a replacement go in how you dealt with the bleeding and it was okay Okay, okay, okay. It was like, do you notice where I switched from using the scalpel or diathermy and where I moved to blunt dissecting? Do you know why I did that? And honestly, first of all, I didn't notice that he did that. And second of all, I had no idea why. I wasn't even thinking about why. And he proceeded to explain to me that that is the point at which the, I can't remember, I think maybe in like a, offshoot of the femoral artery, like a very important artery passes around there. So you need to be careful around that area, which is why he stopped and he started blunt dissecting instead. I thought, okay, that's actually a really good point. And I probably should have known that. And now I feel like an idiot for not knowing that. But that's also when I had the realization that the reason that you would need to know anatomy is not just to know anatomy, but you need to use that knowledge somehow. And I never really thought how to use the knowledge of anatomy beyond like just the very obvious clinical correlate that was taught to me in lectures. So when I started going back through my anatomy and now thinking, okay, let's imagine that I'm operating. How would I study the anatomy if I was operating? And there's this really good scene in this like Korean movie, like TV series on Netflix. And there's this one medical student who has to perform surgery on this other person. And because he's still a student, he has no idea how. So he spends all night studying his anatomy textbooks to devise a strategy for operating. And the reason that I think that scene is really good is because that's exactly the way that I started to study. I put myself in the position where I thought, what if I'm the first person to ever do this operation? How does that make me look at anatomy differently? And when I started doing that, anatomy became so much easier, more engaging and more and just enjoyable and more memorable to learn because there were consequences. There was a context and a sense of relevance to what I was learning. And again, yes, it does take longer, but surprisingly not that much longer and the time you're spending is a lot more enjoyable and you just remember so much more that you're gonna save your time, like truckloads in the long run because something like anatomy is useful for all forms of medicine. Like even saying someone's got chest pain to think, well, how can you work through that? Well, you can take an anatomical approach. Well, if you don't know your anatomy well enough to think about the chest wall and work your way from out to in and understand the structures that are in place that cause chest pain, that's not gonna be very easy for you. If you don't know your abdominal anatomy well enough that if someone says, hey, you've got like left upper quadrant pain and then you can work through anatomically to think where that could be caused from, it's gonna be very difficult. Whereas learning the anatomy very well it's a good foundation for all the other types of learning that you're gonna have to do. Here are my final tips. Here's the things that I wish I had done that I encourage you to do. First of all, as much as possible, whenever you can, try to make things simpler and more intuitive. Don't just learn it the way that it's given to you. Find a way to understand it. It may be less detailed, but give yourself something simple to base things on. a skeleton of a simple and intuitive understanding and a framework to think through. Whenever you feel like, man, there's a lot to remember and a lot to memorize here. Whenever you feel that sense that this could be overwhelming, find a way to break it down and make it simpler. You can always go and learn the details and you should, but you should always do that after you have a very simple and intuitive way of understanding the entire topic. It's going to help you. Also, whenever possible, look for the clinical correlate. yourself, how am I actually going to use this knowledge before you try to learn anything through a pathophys or a disease or you know, very discreet isolated perspective, find a way to think about it from a clinical perspective first, understand it from a clinical perspective first, and then go back to learn more details about the disease or the pathophys. Again, it's going to make it much easier and it's going to make it make more sense. And you're probably going to do better for all your examinations as well, because most medical schools around the world are transitioning towards having examinations that reflect clinical application of knowledge a little bit more closely. Remember, you are not a medical student. You are a doctor in training. And that's a difference. You can try to just keep memorizing and smashing things through forever, but trust me, it doesn't really work. The friends that did that and got their way through medical school and thought, hey, why do you need to change the way that you're studying, you just need to memorize it more. Now they're studying to become a specialist and they're having to relearn all that stuff all over again because they don't remember any of it. And now they're having to learn it through the methods that I'm teaching you now. And honestly, there is no reason that you can't just learn it like how a specialist in training is trying to learn it when you're a pre-clin medical student. It's just a better, more intuitive way to learn the material. My next tip is to pick your losses. You really can't learn absolutely everything that you learn in medical school or just in medicine in general, like it's straight up impossible. And you do have to learn a lot of things. So I would recommend that you kind of pick your losses. Don't try to learn everything. Make a decision about what is important for you to learn and why. Again, coming back to that clinical application. And the things that you feel are less important, you can still try to fit them in when you've got time. But don't try to cover everything. And the final tip here is just how to make use of clinical placements more effectively. I said that I talk about this at the end and this is the final tip. When you're going into a clinical placement, there is a wealth of information that you can possibly extract. Center your studying based on the likely things you will learn from your next day or week in clinical practice. Don't study the things that are like less relevant. If you know that the common conditions you're likely to see in a given placement, chest pain and shortness of breath and some kind of skin rash and like headache, back pain. Center your studying around those things because what you want to do is you want to study something and the very next day you want to have a clinical experience that builds on what you just studied. That could be through seeing a patient or it could be attending a surgery. If you know that you have to spend time in theater and you're going to be there observing a surgery anyway, study about that condition and that surgery the day before so that when you're in there having the mandatory experience and spending the time that you cannot escape, you are at least engaged and you are gaining value from that. There is some part of your learning that is being built on and consolidated. And that also allows you to ask very good questions that your senior is going to realize you really are putting an effort to getting learning out of this experience. and that's something they appreciate, because trust me, when I started having students under me, when I was a doctor, it's very, very clear to see which students actually care and put an effort, and which ones are just there to burn time, and the ones that are there to burn time, you don't really feel very motivated to help them along, whereas the ones that are really motivated, you are more motivated as well to teach them and help them be involved in more things, and to go out of your way a little bit more to help their education. I really regret what I did when I was in my early rotations in clinical placements, where the things that I would be studying on a daily basis were things that my university curriculum said that I need to learn by the end of that placement. And it wasn't really based around the experiences that I anticipated that I'd have the next day or during that week. And what I've realized now is if I focused it on those clinical experiences, I would have covered probably 90, 95% of what I would have needed to know based on what my university mandated. And the other 5%, I could have just easily fitted in around that time, or just before my assessment. It wouldn't have been a problem, but instead I wasted a lot of time and ward rounds and clinical attachment days were so draining and so tiring, and I was not re-engaged and I didn't get a lot of value out of them because I didn't do this. So a bit of a long video, but I hope this has helped you. I certainly wish someone sat down and told me this stuff when I went into medical school. If you want some more techniques around what to do specifically during lectures or with your note taking or with your revision strategies or revision timing or what to do with your flashcards to make them more effective, these types of other specific techniques. I do also have a guided step-by-step program where I've taken all of these techniques, looking at the research, trialing them and seeing what works and what doesn't across thousands of students and packaging it into a single guided step-by-step program that teaches you an entire learning system. If you're interested in that, you can check that out at iconsuddy.com. There's a link in the description. I also have a ton of other videos that provide more specific techniques that you can check out on my YouTube. Thank you so much for watching. I hope this helps and I'll see you next time.", "transcript_length": 4749, "reference_summary": "In his reflective account, Dr. Justin Song shares his experiences and lessons learned from medical school, emphasizing the challenges he faced and the mistakes he made. He acknowledges that while medical school was a unique and enriching experience, it was also fraught with stress and difficulties that could have been mitigated with a different approach to learning. One significant error he made was over-engineering his study methods, which worked well for exams but failed to translate into practical clinical knowledge. This led to a shocking failure in his first clinical attachment, where he realized that his exam-focused learning did not equip him for real-life patient interactions. Additionally, Dr. Song points out that he struggled with discerning the necessary level of detail in his studies, resulting in fragmented knowledge that hindered his ability to synthesize complex patient cases. He emphasizes the importance of building a solid foundational understanding rather than merely memorizing facts for exams. Through his journey, Dr. Song aims to guide future medical students to avoid similar pitfalls, encouraging them to adopt more effective learning strategies that will serve them throughout their careers.", "channel": "Justin Sung"}

It's responsible for all the facets of our personality, everything we think and everything we feel. It makes you you. A very large fraction of what's happening in my brain, I am not aware of it all. But what exactly is going on in your unconscious brain? Part of your brain is really in charge. All day long, we're doing unscripted things that we didn't know we would be doing. Life is not scripted. Find a word that has some meaning for you. So you might think you've made a choice. Representation. But in the back of your mind, you wonder, come on, was that really me? We might feel like we're in control. This idea that we're in control of our actions seems critical to our sense of identity. But our brains may have other ideas. The brain is made of almost 90 billion neurons, but it produces this illusion that there's a single person inside our skulls. For every Pinocchio, there's always someone kind of pulling the strings behind the scenes. There can be two separated minds inside one system. It's not just that motor memory language is in the brain. Your personality is up there. Your morality is up there. We as humans know how environment and traumatic events change people. Your brain, who's in control? Right now on NOVA. Have you ever thought that you've made a crystal clear decision? I'm just going to watch two episodes tonight. But the next thing you know, okay, just one more episode. Actually, it's time to go to bed. Well, I bet everyone else has already finished this season. Wait, why am I still watching this? Well, of course the answer lies in your brain. Your brain contains multitudes. It's a complex and intricate three-pound piece of matter. But you actually have no awareness of most of the things that are going on inside your brain. I'm neuroscientist and clinical psychologist Heather Berlin. And I'm on a journey to discover what's really driving the decisions you make. No agency at all. Who or what is really in control? There are important unconscious processes in your brain that you're not aware of. Most of the time, the brain is a coordinated, well-oiled machine, with different brain regions working together in harmony. But under certain circumstances, when things are out of sync, we can gain deeper insight into how the brain actually works. There's one thing we do every day with little to no conscious control. It's something you might spend a whole third of your life doing. Sleeping. When we sleep, we're supposed to be unconscious and at rest. But for some people, that's not always the case. These are people who sleepwalk. Sleepwalking is a glitch in the system because our identity is not in control. And that's what a lot of my patients tell me, like, I didn't do that. That's not possible. This is not me. So sleepwalking is a very common condition or phenomenon. Simply said, it's where the word is. You sleep, but during your sleep, you will walk. We take it for granted, right? But walking is extremely complex. Just teaching a robot all the inputs and outputs for a body to move forward on two legs without falling. All of this, you don't even think about it. It works independently. How is it possible to do complex behaviors like walking, eating, and sometimes even driving while sleeping? To find out, I'm visiting a sleep center at the Icon School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. So tell me a little bit about what's happening with you at night and your sleepwalking. Well, I've been doing some weird things. I painted a wall in my living room and one in my kitchen. I made a triangle, a perfect triangle in my kitchen. So what do you think when you find that? I don't know, just I laugh because I go, how the heck I did this? Emanuel during studies what's going on in the brain when someone sleepwalks. In the center, sleep patients are wired up with sensors that pick up eye and body movements, as well as their brain waves, while they sleep. So what are we looking at here, these blue lines? These are the eye movements. Okay, and then the black lines here? These are the brain waves. So these patients obviously is lying in bed. And those are off, slowly, feel sleepy, and as we move on, it dives into deep, slow wave sleep. During sleep, your brain cycles through phases of high and low activity. When the brain waves slow down, scientists call this deep sleep. But when someone sleepwalks... First of all, everything looks good. You see the brain waves. Everything is very monotonous, sort of slow waves. And then it's interesting, there's a build-up of slow waves that the amplitude goes up. Then suddenly, so he's seemingly awake, sudden. It's like a sudden arousal. Looks sort of scared. Very brief, very fast, eyes open. There's sort of a split then. The patient looks like they're awake, but a couple of key brain regions seem to stay asleep. There's part of the brain stays in slow wave sleep. It's such a deep stage of sleep. It's hard to wake up and the other part of the brain is already awake. One part of the brain that doesn't wake up during sleepwalking is called the prefrontal cortex. It's the region of the brain responsible for deliberate choices and self-awareness. This prefrontal cortex is the decision maker. The other areas of the brain can mostly work independently of that. So essentially so many parts of the brain can be engaged without conscious awareness of it. During sleepwalking, the motor cortex which controls movement, the visual cortex which processes visual information, and the parts of the brain that coordinate behaviors like balance and speech can all become active without engaging the prefrontal cortex. And what exactly are you doing, ma'am? It's a special code. of sleepwalking reveal that being conscious is not an all or none situation. Our unconscious makes a lot of everyday decisions for us. For starters, boring stuff like regulating your heart rate and your temperature, deciding when to take the food in your stomach and move it down into your gut. Like, thank God we don't have to be aware of all that stuff. sensory function, sensory integration, memory representation. All of this is happening below the surface, like the inside of a clockwork. When you sleepwalk, the brain regions that control your movement, vision and breathing can get up to all kinds of mischief without you even knowing it. But there's one case where even those regions check out during anesthesia. We know that there are drugs that I can give you anesthetics that would remove your conscious experience. And we all know that consciousness comes in degrees. We can lose consciousness in sleep, but then we lose it in a more profound way when we are under general anesthesia. When I was a young researcher working in anesthesiology, I saw this firsthand. So what happens to your brain activity when you go under? Neuroscientist Emery Brown is measuring the line that separates being conscious from being unconscious. I want to guarantee my patients that when I say you're unconscious, you're not going to perceive pain. You won't be moving around. You won't remember anything that's occurring. Your heart rate and blood pressure and other physiological systems will be well controlled. The patient is undergoing surgery. But before the surgeons can operate, the anesthesiologists have to put her under, render her unconscious with special drugs. I'm starting to give you medicines that might make you feel kind of drowsy. Look straight ahead. Look straight ahead. So her eyes move as we'd expect them to. So you're moving her head, but her eyes stay straight. We're gonna have you breathe. Breathe some oxygen for a minute. Can you see my finger here? Follow with your eyes. And if you can't follow it anymore, tell me, all right? Can you hear me? See, her eyes are fixed now. Yeah. She has a large, slow oscillation signal. Yeah, yeah. Her brainstem is out. That's out? That's it? Mm-hmm. When you go under, it can feel like one second you're here, and the next, you're out. What's going on in the brain when this happens? Emory uses a device called an EEG, a set of electrodes that rests on the scalp and detects electrical activity in the brain. That activity comes in the form of waves. The brain generates brain waves, brain waves are oscillations. And they're oscillations that we typically see when someone's conscious. These brain waves are measured by their frequency, how fast the waves come and go. And by their amplitude, how small or big the waves are. I look at your EEG when you're awake. You're gonna have a very rich response. When I anesthetize you, it goes away. And so the difference between those two states represents the transition from being conscious to the unconscious. I can see the oscillations, see how they're really big now. And before, so they were just sort of little... Yeah, exactly. When you're awake and fully aware, your brainwave activity is diverse and dynamic. It looks kind of like an exciting conversation. But when anesthesia drugs hit the brain, the activity is dramatically reduced to dull, slow, rolling brainwaves. The once dynamic conversation becomes an unintelligible hum. If you're able to have the parts of the brain communicate sufficiently, you can make someone unconscious. So that's what the drugs are doing. They're altering the way the various parts of the brain communicate. There's one region of the brain in particular that acts as a communication hub, the thalamus. It's made up of two parts, each about the size of a walnut, and sits deep inside your brain. Thalamus is a central way station for all sorts of information processing. Auditory information goes through there, visual information goes through there, pain information goes through there. If I could take out just one brain center to make you unconscious, it would probably be the thalamus, because it's such a central actor in processing all types of information. After a couple of hours of surgery, the medical team is tapering off the anesthesia drugs. And the EEG reveals the patient's brainwave activity becoming more complex as she wakes up. She started and takes a deep breath, so, yeah. Yeah, open your eyes wide. And squeeze my hand. Consciousness is really having active cognitive processing, being able to think and act. Surgery's all done, okay? It's the integration of that information which allows us to start to understand how consciousness is actually form. Consciousness can obviously interact with the physical world like we can. We can use drugs to remove it. We go to sleep and we're not conscious. And yet it's tenuous at the same time. We can't say how any specific set of neurons working together produces consciousness. It's so clear that anesthesia is some kind of change of consciousness, right? The whole brain is there, the pieces are there, but the messages aren't getting through in a way that makes for a conscious experience. And that's the difference between being aware and not being aware. So the level of communication among brain regions is one difference between being conscious and being unconscious. That means that no single area of the brain is responsible for your consciousness. It's that communication that helps make you, you. Now let's remember that the left hand is governed from the right hemisphere. For some people, an entire half of their brain can't really communicate with the rest. These are people who have undergone split brain surgery, and it says if. They have two minds in a single brain. Now the question becomes, is what happens when you allow both hands together to try to solve the problem. And what we find out is that they fight over each other. One hand knows how to do it, and one hand does not, and so they more or less squabble. The human brain contains two sides, the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere, right? And they are connected by a big bundle of fibers. It's called the corpus callosum. All the communication from one side of the brain to the other has to pass through this fiber bundle. For some people with epilepsy, a seizure in one hemisphere can quickly spread to the other by way of the corpus callosum. But if that bridge is surgically severed, a seizure can no longer cross to the other side of the brain. In addition to treating epilepsy, these surgeries have also led to some astounding research into how the two hemispheres function. With your left hand, make me the A-OK sign. To learn more about these fascinating studies, I met two pioneers in the field, Michael Miller and Michael Guzanica. Michael Miller asked me to step into his lab to do a few simple tests, just like the ones he's conducted with patients after a split brain surgery. So, Heather, what you're gonna see are two shapes. They're gonna come up on the screen. You'll draw the shape on the left side of the screen with your left hand and the shape on the right side in the screen with your right hand. And I want you to draw them as quickly as you can at the same time, okay? Okay. Piece of cake, right? Oh. Beautiful. Okay. And that's sure what you're drawing over here, but... Oh. Oh. That's okay. Can I mention I didn't get that much sleep last night? The left side of the brain controls most of the right side of the body, and the right side of the brain controls most of the left side of the body. I'm just like, start out trying to do different things, and then they just start to like sync up together. Yeah, yeah. Come on, man! It's perfectly normal. So, I mean, what's happening is that the motor commands in one hemisphere are interfering with the motor commands and the other hemisphere. It was basically impossible for me to force my hands to draw two different things at the same time. But for someone whose two hemispheres are disconnected, there's no interference. It's almost as if there's one mind controlling the left hand and a completely different mind controlling the right hand. And it isn't just movement that's split across the hemispheres. Only half of your visual field goes to each side of the brain. When you're looking straight ahead, everything to the left side of that space goes only to the right hemisphere. And the opposite is true for the right side of the space. The left part of the brain is where your language and speech centers are. That enables you to talk, enables you to understand language, and all the rest. And the right side of your brain is very important and the evaluation of emotions, evaluation of visual space. I'm gonna give you a test. If you look right up near those, I'm gonna throw that in my hands. You tell me how many fingers you see, all right? How many fingers do you see? You see two, right? Why did you see two? This one went to your left hemisphere. This one went to your right hemisphere, way over in the other side of your brain. How does your left hemisphere know about it? That pathway, the corpus callosum, it transfers that information. Now I'm gonna split your brain. And I do the same tests. How many fingers do I see? Is there anything else? No. You see one, you see this one, because that goes straight to your left-talking hemisphere. This one is still going to your right hemisphere, which has now been disconnected from your left. So your left brain can't talk about this. So you now say you only see one finger, even though your right brain is seeing this finger, it just can't talk about it because the highway that communicates that information has been cut. Show me with your right hand what to say. Okay. Down, relax. Show me what your left hand might just say. One, two. It's the most remarkable thing to witness. You know, there's this whole other entity in the head that's controlling the body and can understand and remember and feel and think all on its own, completely separate from the other side. The researchers conducted tests to explore how a split-brain patient's two hemispheres work independently from one another, including a now-famous experiment of a patient named Joe. Look right at that. By quickly flashing a word to just the left side of his visual field, that word would go exclusively to the right half of his brain, the half that can't talk. So the only way we're gonna know that it registered is if he can write something out, okay? With his hand that is controlled by his right hand Exactly. He was left-handed. He's left-handed. We flashed the word Texas. Look right and dot. See anything? And flash. See the word. His right hemisphere is seeing it. We're seeing it, but the right hemisphere, at this point in his surgery, cannot talk. Right. All right, I want you to draw for me that thing upside down. So he claims to not have seen anything. Oh my God. Wow. He was even on two Texas upside down. What's interesting is he had no idea what he was drawing. We know because we saw the word. I can't tell what it is. Wow. Later on, I show him the word again and I ask a different question about what he saw. Once again, they showed the word Texas to just his right nonverbal hemisphere. So when asked about what he saw, all his left hemisphere can say is... I'm aware of where they just did see what it was. Draw something that goes with that, a symbol of that. Oh, wow. So he draws a cowboy hat. Clearly, it's right here, and it's not exactly what he's drawing. But he's left it still confused. It's like he doesn't understand. Right. What's that? Cowboy hat. Cowboy hat? What was the word? Texas. I can't believe it. Did you see Texas? No. The split-brain phenomenon suggests that there can be two separated minds, if you will, inside of a skull. The cooperation is on the paper, not inside the head. It's an astounding example of cross-cuing and management of two mental systems into one unified act. And the idea is maybe that's going on in us all the time too. Each of us has a sense that we're a unitary being, but actually that belies the fact that each of us, each of our minds, is actually composed of lots of different pieces that are doing different things. And different information can be represented in different parts of that machinery. And so a search for where am I in all of this is a little bit misguided because the eye is not such a unitary thing in the first place. That feeling of unity of me is actually distributed across almost 90 billion neurons. This illusion that there's a single person inside our skulls. Inside your brain are over 100 distinct regions. Many different systems in the brain control what you do, from movement to vision to speech, and even social interaction. I think most human beings like to believe that their mind is under their own control. If I want to, I can stand up right now. I can do that. And that gives me, I think, the false belief that everything I do has been chosen by me. And if there is a story from the brain to tell, it is that we are quite wrong. Not only are there multiple parts of your brain influencing you, but there are things in the world around you that influence your brain, including other people. How we act and who we are in our lives is hugely determined by the expectations of the people around us. The brain helps us be the most social species on the planet. A lot of our brains are devoted to understanding other people. A brain doesn't operate in isolation. We constantly learn, take, compare to other brains. Our brains have evolved to be able to effortlessly reason about other people. And emotions similarly have evolved as ways that guide our behavior. So how exactly do emotions and the emotions of others influence our brains? Another scientist, Luke Chang, studies how emotions like greed and guilt affect our decision-making. Hey Grace, we're going to start up the scout. Go ahead and make your decision. Okay, you're totally good. Yep, you can hit next. So what are you guys looking at here? What's this study about? So she's playing an investment game with another participant who's outside the scanner. scans the brains of study participants while they play a game from behavioral economics called the Trust Game. This is a cooperative game where one person has some of money and they can choose to invest any amount of that money in their partner. That investment grows. So then the study participant has to decide. They could be greedy and keep all the money. Or they could be generous and give some of the investment back. We've always been really interested in why do people return the money when they don't have to. And guilt provides one plausible mechanism that might be driving their behavior to act cooperatively in this game. So you're balancing and making these decisions between getting that kind of dopamine reward hit from being a little selfish versus being balanced by those feelings of maybe guilt when you're not cooperating or helping somebody else out. And the brain scans reveal which parts of the brain are most active when someone is feeling guilt. Those regions ended up being something called the insula. Signals about having this gut feeling that maybe this isn't a good idea or I'd feel really bad if I did that. Those are the signals that are reaching from the insula that allow us to make decisions to avoid harming someone else. Luke likes to think of it kind of like a thermometer and a thermostat. If you try to think about how a thermostat might be mapped onto the brain, one region might be more like the thermometer detecting the ambient temperature in the room. When it comes to reading the room, our brain's thermometer seems to be the insula. all that information needs to go somewhere else and be integrated with other types of information. That's our brain's thermostat, a region located inside the prefrontal cortex that processes our emotions and helps regulate our behavior. And while your thermostat can usually help you take control of your emotions, what would happen if it went out? There's a famous patient named Phineas Gage. Phineas Gage was a railroad foreman who was working on Vermont. And he was tamping down a hole that had gum powder in it. And the gum powder ignited, sending the rod through his eye, up through his brain, taking out a big patch of his brain in the process. At first, people thought, well, this is a miracle. This is a miracle. This man has been unscathed from this accident. He had memory, he had language, he had motor control. But of course his friends noticed a difference. His life fell apart. He had a hard time holding a job. He lost all of his friends. And he really just struggled. His personality made him more fitful, irreverent, more profane. He was cursing a lot, lewd behavior. So he had sort of no filter. We now know that the parts of the brain that he sort of surgically excised were involved in emotion and control. Over a hundred years later, neuroscientists mapped the regions of his brain that were harmed in that horrific accident. Areas of his prefrontal cortex, including the brain's thermostat, were damaged, which might account for why he struggled socially. He couldn't regulate his emotions or process how other people might react to his behavior. And that was the key moment, I think, in neuroscience history when people realized, oh, it's not just that motor memory language is in the brain. Your personality is up there. Your morality is up there. Things that make you, you are there. I think we all kind of know intuitively that emotions impact our decisions. So what sort of extra information is this giving us? In a lot of the scientific work that's been done on studying emotion decision making, people have really focused on how emotions lead us to make worse decisions, maybe even irrational. And I actually don't think that's true. If you have a goal to not want to harm others and to do what's going to be in your self-interest, emotions are actually helping us make better decisions. We are, in fact, the company that we keep because other people bring out parts of us and strengthen us in particular ways. How you make decisions, how you behave, how you think about yourself, all of these processes we develop by mimicking and interacting and synchronizing with other brains. One thing that we all share as humans is that social life and social contact is an incredibly important part of what our brain processes. Where our brains are in detail influenced by every experience we have. Every moment, every sentence, every image changes your brain. And certain experiences are so profound, so extreme, that they can impact brain biology from one generation to the next. Neuroscientist Bianca Jones Marlin is studying how your ancestors' experiences might control how your brain is wired today. We ask how trauma affects the brain, how trauma affects the body, and really how trauma affects generations. People in the world suffer from traumatic events, and these traumatic events aren't just a one-time change on their brain and their body. It actually continues for seemingly their lifetime. Bianca's research is inspired by her upbringing. My parents, my biological parents, were also foster parents, so I had foster siblings and adopted siblings growing up. Only now, as a scientist, I realize that that motivates a lot of the questions that I ask. How do we understand what happens when kids are born into trauma and optimize what we do have for better generations? One insight comes from an event during World War II. At the end of World War II, the Netherlands were cut off from food by Nazi troops because they decided to protest through the country. And during this period of time, it created a man-made famine. There was starvation, death, there was trauma. Not only did those who suffered during the famine experience health problems, but some of their children and even their grandchildren had metabolic issues. So people began to ask, how does an experience of a parent, of a grandparent, change offspring? Researchers began to discover that your environment and your experiences can change the way your genes are activated in your body and in your brain. It's not like you get your genes in a sudden stone, they're constantly changing based on the environment. To see this in action, Bianca studies mice. We're able to map the whole genome of mice, target certain areas of that genetic code, and use them to answer the important questions in science. So how could stress and trauma alter the biology of the mice's offspring? To find out, Bianca paired the smell of almond with an electric shock. Because mice really navigate the world and rely heavily on this sense of smell, we use olfaction, pair it with a light foot shock, and we observe changes in the brain and changes in behavior. She noticed that something inside of the mice's noses changed. We're able to look at the cells in the nose that only respond to almond. And what we observe is that after the light foot shock and the presentation of almond coinciding, there are more cells in the nose that express the almond receptor. It says if something in the milieu of the nose says, almond's important in this environment, we need more cells like you. Mice grew more cells that responded to the smell of almond. Each one of these three in dots you see here, these are neurons. There are cells that can respond to the almond smell. These red dots are cells that were born after the presentation of odor and shock. And this cell right here, this red and green cell, is a cell that was born after the presentation of almond and shock that also responds to almond. This is the cell that we want to look at to see what information is inside, because we see more of these after the odor and shock pairing. remarkably, these changes were actually passed down to the next generation. The offspring, the kids of the parents, that were shocked with odor were born with more cells that express the almond receptor, which means there's a memory that somehow is maintained in sperm, in egg, through implantation, and represented in offspring. It is as if we are observing a change in evolution over the time span of one generation. I just think that's fascinating. Because we as humans, you know how environment and how traumatic events change people. Just being able to take the science of that and being able to show that, we're just just justifying what we already know as humans. What society has known for a long time, what individuals know. We just want to bring that to an undeniable truth. Our brains are not static. We try to make sense of what's happening right now. We also try to make sense of what happened a long time ago and to have like this grand picture of our life as a trajectory. Our ability for conscious awareness. It's a magnificent ability, this ability to reflect on our own minds, but it also leads us astray. I have memories, plans, I have these feelings of agency over my actions, but what the science itself is telling us is that these things aren't necessarily bound together. Different aspects of the self can be manipulated or even taken away altogether. Your biology and the choices you make are all molded by your social interactions and even your family history. And yet we feel like we have control, like we have agency, right? MUSIC An agent is somebody that is the author of their own story. But actually, most of what's happening in our brain, we are not conscious of. And I think this gets you starting to think, Wait a minute. You know, is really everything under my control? Neuroscientist Uri Maus is putting our sense of control to the test. We feel like we're in control, but where exactly does that feeling come from, and how does it work? Ah, here you are. Hello. Thank you very much for joining us agentically and out of your own volition. Of course. Before we start, let me give you this envelope. Okay. Please don't let anybody touch it. And don't look inside, but we'll need it for later on. For later, okay. To show me how my sense of control isn't always what it seems, I'll kick things off by trying to get me to question my ability to choose by using a magic trick. So where would you like to sit? Where would I like to sit? It's really up to you. It's really, I have a choice. You have a choice? All right, so I'm gonna sit here. You're gonna sit over there. Yes. How about just before you sit down if you don't mind. Mm-hmm. Let's see what this says. Oh my God, okay. So. So then that one obviously says the same thing, right? Um, well, let's check and see what this one says. This one says. Oh, come on. So I'm that predictable? You don't even know me yet. I really don't know how he did that. I'm not totally convinced, but I'm starting to question, how do I know when I have made a decision? If I may, let me give you, as a present, a book. Here you go, this is yours, and I will just ask you to leaf through it and find a word that has some meaning for you. All right, I got it. Can you tell me what the word is? Representation. Please write the word down, representation, And then you'll just stick that sticky note somewhere in that page. Okay. Thank you. We'll come back to that later. But for now, I'm starting to see how choice and agency aren't always so straightforward. So to find out what's actually going on in the brain when our sense of control is in question, I took a look at a trial designed by postdoctoral researcher Alice Wong. A volunteer from the lab, Tomasz, is being fitted with a transcranial magnetic stimulation device, TMS for short. It generates a strong magnetic field that can send signals to your brain. The idea is that you stimulate the brain using a focused magnetic field, and if you stimulate that in the right part of the motor cortex, it's a part of the brain that actually controls your fingers, it's like you're pulling on a string here. Every time you pull it, the finger goes. With the device hooked up, the researchers can make his finger jump involuntarily by sending a signal to his motor cortex. We're going to be locating the spot of your motor cortex that moves one of your fingers. How about that? That works. That was a pinky movement up. Okay. Sometimes they ask him to move his finger on his own. Could you replicate the movement if and that you felt? Or something like this? Remarkably, by recording the small electrical signals that travel from his brain down to his finger muscles, Alice and Urey can pinpoint the exact moment that Tamash's brain has initiated a movement, almost 50 milliseconds before he actually moves. With this information, it's as though they can predict his movement slightly before it actually happens. So now his sense of agency is about to be put to the test. Who initiated the movement? It was me. How much agency did you feel over the movement? What a lot. Full agency? Okay. Normally, the researcher isn't in the room, and all the questions are conducted by the computer. Who initiated the movement? I don't know. How much agency did you feel over the movement? I would say some agency. In some instances, just as Tomas decides to move his finger, the researchers use the magnetic field to make his finger move. Who initiated the movement? I really don't know. Okay. How much agency did you feel over the movement? A little bit. So even in the instances when Tomasz really did decide to move his finger... How much agency did you feel over the movement? No agency at all. He didn't always feel like he was in control. So after the experiment, I was excited to hear the results. When Tomasz initiated the movement himself, yet we intervened with the TMS, Tomasz said, that wasn't me. I didn't initiate the movement. It was the computer. He thought that the computer initiated the movement, or it was both of them, or he wasn't sure, but he almost never said that it was him. So what do you think is going on there? How is this happening? You know, we walk around and we feel like, you know, we are the authors of our actions and so on, and you can see with just a little bit of messing around, it tends to fall apart. It's fragile, like our sense of self, our memories, our sense of agency. They're all things that our brain evolved over time, over time, but they're fragile and they can be manipulated under the right circumstances. Everything has to align for you to feel this sense of agency. When the finger moves, we get this feedback back to the brain and it's incorporated with whatever's happening in the brain to create the movement and together you get this sense of agency over the movement. I think that in everyday life, we are in control. However, I think this experiment shows we're quite happy to relinquish control. Like states of consciousness, there are levels of agency, ways that can be manipulated and even taken away. We think A happened and then B happened as the end of the story. But of course, most of our brain activity is unconscious. Who initiated the first movement? That was me. So we sometimes misinterpret our experience of voluntary action is a little bit retrospective in this sense. The brain looks at what the body did and figures out if that makes sense as an act of its own free will. After the agency experiment, we had more important matters to attend to. So, Heather, when you came in, I gave you an envelope, right? Yes. Nobody touched it but you? No. Do you remember that later on, I gave you that book? And in that book, you open it to whatever page you wanted and you found a word in there. Can you tell us again what that word was? Yes, it was on page 105. And the word was representation. Representation. OK, so if you don't mind just putting the book aside and if you could take the envelope out now. Can you open it and see what's inside, please? Oh, this is one of these things that's going to freak me out, right? Let's see. Getting chills. Come on. No way. Come on, no seriously. That's really freaky. So you're in control, right? I don't know how you did that. That is really weird. I mean, what do I do now? I don't know where to look at what I do with that. Erie's magic acts are tricks, slights of hand, and misdirection. But when I saw what was written on the card, I have to admit, I wondered if my choices mattered at all. Let me do this. Alice Wong's experiment supports the idea that it isn't just about what happens in the brain at the moment a decision is made. How did you do that? Your sense of agency or control also has to do with feedback you get after the decision, physical, social, and emotional. I think of agency as a sense. So there is a sense of agency that sometimes can get disrupted, perhaps, just like you have a sense of sight or smell and so on. Sometimes you have visual illusions. It's similar with a sense of agency. I can manipulate your sense of agency, But that doesn't mean that we never have a sense of agency. Your brain is a meaning maker machine. And creating a sense of agency is one of the ways it makes meaning out of your daily life. There is no way in which I can operate without understanding what is happening and why I'm doing it. It's the filling in of the blanks that is necessary in some ways for survival to give meaning, to make sense of the cause and effect of things. Perhaps we have that feeling of consciousness because it gives me a sense of agency. It allows me to pretend like I'm the one making decisions and I'm the one reaping the rewards or the failures of that particular decision. There are parts of the brain that allow you to feel like the author of your own life. But that's only part of the story. Each of our minds is actually composed of lots of different pieces that are doing different things. This illusion that there's a single person inside our skulls. We know how environment and how traumatic events change people. Our brains are in detail influenced by the expectations of the people around us. But of course, most of our brain activity is unconscious. But there are some situations where letting A go of conscious control can have amazing results. When you're playing the blues, you have this kind of well-known musical structure, this template, and then you use that as a launch pad for improvisation, for innovation, and for new ideas. Charles Lim is a neuroscientist trying to understand how our brain operates when we are being truly creative. And today he's using a scanner to peer into the brain of educator and freestyle rapper Chris Emden. You ready for me? Okay, remember keep your head still during the entire thing and try not to move your feet or your hands at all during the rapping. First, Charles asks Chris to perform a memorized piece. Now that memory means you're going to do the memorized lyrics the way you originally wrote them. Okay? Okay. Memory. I'm a physicist, lyricist, and this ridiculousness, so witness the ignorance I dismiss. Knows those emotions that's out of the course. Staying emotionless, they have no balance for us. Next, he gives him a prompt and asks him to improvise, to create a new original piece on the spot. He doesn't know what's coming, and that's going to be his cues for that. Please, not. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. Physicists. I don't know what it is that it's like. I'm like a peaceful player the way I strike with the raps. That's good. So what does improvisation or spontaneous creativity look like in the brain? What we found was that the prefrontal cortex that appears to be linked to effortful self-monitoring seem to be turning off, deactivating in a pretty intense way in these highly trained professional musicians when they started improvising. So in some sense, by letting go, by decreasing activation in the prefrontal cortex, we can sort of gain control of our lives in a way. In fact, if you're too self-conscious and you're unable to relax and like, oh, you can't do something like this, when you start trying to put conscious control mechanism, your performance goes down. So would you say this goes to any activity really if you're a professional tennis player or if you're trying to do a physical activity, that the more you're able to practice letting go, once you've learned the skill, the better you'll be. Exactly. Free throw shooters that are able to shoot 99% free throws. All of a sudden, when you tell them you're going to get a million dollars if you make the next one, then all of a sudden, you inject conscious control over something that's much better, just left to its own subconsciousness, and then your performance gets worse and you're more likely to choke. Surprisingly, the parts of your brain that are usually in control can get in your way. Your prefrontal cortex, the decision maker, can make you overthink something you've done a thousand times. Freestyle, stay. Yes, you want me to stay, relax, but I will never play. Every human being is creative. Whether they're creative artistically or not is another question, but we're all creative. We have to be because all day long, we're doing unscripted things that we didn't know we would be doing. Life is not scripted. And so no matter who you are in this world, you're doing things that are unplanned. All day long, we're balancing forces that push us around, even if we're not aware of them, from past trauma to the emotions of others and all the hidden forces affecting your brain. I'd like to believe that I am in charge of my life, that I am the agent of my life, that I actually can control my emotions, my abilities, my desires. And the more I learn about brains, the more I realize that this is probably not true. We can be influenced by our social networks, by our culture, by our genetics, by our development, by our childhood. Your brain is a complicated collection of these intricate parts, many of which you have no awareness of. And they all work together in a delicate dance to create your perception of you. The brain is who you are. It's really different than any other organ in that sense. We know that every experience, every thought, every memory, every sensation has its origin in the brain. The brain is made of almost 90 billion neurons, But it produces the idea that there's a single thing inside my head. My particular pattern of neuronal connections, it actually creates me. And your particular pattern of neuronal connections actually creates you. Years of studying the brain have humbled me. You look scared. You can't control everything that makes you who you are. But the unconscious you is still you. The vast majority of the brain's work is happening outside conscious awareness. If you try to over control some things, you actually will decrease your performance. You have to let go of conscious self-monitoring to just kind of like go at the flow. It could be scary to say and scary to hear, but we are not just our own. We are all multifaceted, multidimensional people. And by becoming more aware of the unconscious processes in your own brain, you can become more aware of what drives you and what you ultimately can control. I'm not sure what to do with this. I'm just going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room. I'm going to go back to the room.", "transcript_length": 7768, "reference_summary": "The brain remains one of science's greatest enigmas, governing our thoughts, feelings, and identity while often operating beneath our conscious awareness. Neuroscientist Heather Berlin explores this mystery, questioning who truly controls our actions. Despite the illusion of agency, much of our decision-making occurs unconsciously, with various brain regions collaborating seamlessly. This complexity is exemplified in phenomena like sleepwalking, where individuals perform intricate tasks without conscious control, leading them to question their identity and actions. Berlin visits a sleep center to investigate the brain's activity during sleepwalking, revealing how the brain can execute complex behaviors autonomously. Through this exploration, she highlights the duality of our minds\u2014where conscious thought and unconscious processes coexist, shaping our experiences and decisions in ways we often do not comprehend. The journey into understanding the brain's hidden workings not only sheds light on sleepwalking but also challenges our perceptions of self-control and identity.", "channel": "NOVA PBS Official"}

The video is divided into three sections. Introduction to gastroenterology, gastroscopy and colonoscopy. In the first section, we'll review the basic anatomy of the gastrointestinal system. In the second section, we'll learn about a procedure called gastroscopy, which looks through your mouth into your stomach. In the third section, we'll learn about colonoscopy, which lets your doctor examine the inside of your large intestine. Gastroenterology is the area of medicine that deals with the digestive system and how your body breaks down food so that it can be absorbed by your intestines to feed the rest of your body. The digestive system is divided into two main areas. The first area includes the long winding muscular tube that goes from your mouth to your rectum and includes the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, the large intestine, and the appendix. The The second area includes the liver, the pancreas, the bile duct, and the gallbladder, which help the other organs digest your food. In this program, we'll focus on the hollow organs responsible for food digestion, the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine. At the top of the digestive tract is the esophagus. It's a kind of pipe that runs from just beyond the mouth, near the level of the vocal cords, down to the stomach, and is about 15 to 17 inches long. Just like at the top of the esophagus, there's a ring-like muscle at the bottom that acts like a valve, keeping food and stomach acid from reflexing back up from the stomach into the throat. The esophagus leads into the stomach, which is a sac shaped like the letter J. This is where food is stored and where stomach juices start digesting the solid food into a liquid mixture. The small intestine is a very long tube that runs from the stomach to the large intestine. This tube is about 6 meters or 20 feet long feet long and includes the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ilium. It takes three to four hours for food to travel from your stomach to the end of this long tube. In the small intestine, food continues to break down into tiny pieces that will provide nutrition and energy that your body needs to function. Finally, in the large intestine or colon, which is about three to four feet long, the last Most of the water from the food you eat is removed and the solid waste material stays in your colon and is pushed into the rectum where it is expelled when you have a bowel movement. You have been referred to a gastroenterologist. A gastroenterologist is a doctor who specializes in the digestive system. We'll discuss some of the reasons why you might need to see a gastroenterologist. The neurologist's main job is to try and look into the cause of some symptoms that may be related to the gut or the gastrointestinal tract. And that includes a number of things. It can include difficulty swallowing, it can include heartburn or regurgitation, the feeling of food or liquid coming up into the throat. It may include chest pain, stomach pains, abnormal stomach cramps, sometimes vomiting, unexplained weight loss, bleeding, and changes in bowel habit as well. Perhaps changes or increase in diarrhea or constipation. All of these are symptoms that may trigger a gastroenterologist to look into the cause of your symptoms. Other reasons that you may be asked to see a gastroenterologist, for example, would include screening or surveillance. for example would be to look for disease because somebody else in your family may have a condition or because you have a risk factor for a condition, for example, such as colon polyps or stomach cancer or something like that. Surveillance is when investigations may be conducted to follow up on a condition that has been identified previously. So if you've been identified as having, for example, barats esophagus, then it may be decided that it would be important for you to have further investigation to make sure the condition doesn't progress. In addition, you may be asked to see a gastroenterologist because somebody else has identified a conditional made a diagnosis and the gastroenterologist then has the expertise or the ability to recommend a particular course of treatment or particular series of further investigations to help treat you rather more precisely. There are a number of different tests and procedures a gastroenterologist might want to do.

That's over 365 kilograms a year per person and more than 28,800 kilograms over the course of a lifetime. And every last scrap makes its way through the digestive system. Comprised of 10 organs covering 9 meters and containing over 20 specialized cell types, this is one of the most diverse and complicated systems in the human body. Its parts continuously work in unison to fulfill a singular task, transforming the raw materials of your food into the nutrients and energy that keep you alive. Spanning the entire length of your torso, the digestive system has four main components. First, there's the gastrointestinal tract, a twisting channel that transports your food and has an internal surface area of between 30 and 40 square meters. Enough to cover half a badminton court. Second, there's the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver, a trio of organs that break down food using an array of special juices. Third, the body's enzymes, hormones, nerves, and blood all work together to break down food, modulate the digestive process, and deliver its final products. Finally, there's the mesentery, a large stretch of tissue that supports and positions all your digestive organs in the abdomen, enabling them to do their jobs. The digestive process begins before food even hits your tongue. Anticipating a tasty morsel, glands in your mouth start to pump out saliva. We produce about 1.5 liters of this liquid each day. Once inside your mouth, chewing combines with the sloshing saliva to turn food into a moist lump, called the bolus. Enzymes present in the saliva break down any starch. Then your food finds itself at the rim of a 25 centimeter long tube called the esophagus, down which it must plunge to reach the stomach. Nerves in the surrounding esophageal tissue sense the bolus' presence and trigger peristalsis, a series of defined muscular contractions. That propels the food into the stomach, where it's left at the mercy of the muscular stomach walls, which pound the bolus, breaking it into chunks. Hormones secreted by cells in the lining trigger the release of acids and enzyme-rich juices from the stomach wall that start to dissolve the food and break down its proteins. These hormones also alert the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder to produce digestive juices and transfer bile, a yellowish-green liquid that digests fat, in preparation for the next stage. After three hours inside the stomach, the once shapely bolus is now a frothy liquid called chyme, and it's ready to move into the small intestine. The liver sends bile to the gallbladder, which secretes it into the first portion of the small intestine, called the duodenum. Here, it dissolves the fats floating in the slurry of chyme so they can be easily digested by the pancreatic and intestinal juices that have leached onto the scene. These enzyme-rich juices break the fat molecules down into fatty acids and glycerol for easier absorption into the body. The enzymes also carry out the final deconstruction of proteins into amino acids and carbohydrates into glucose. This happens in the small intestine's lower regions, the jejunum and ilium, which are coated in millions of tiny projections called villi. These create a huge surface area to maximize molecule absorption and transference into the bloodstream. The blood takes them on the final leg of their journey to feed the body's organs and tissues. But it's not over quite yet. Left over fiber, water, and dead cells sloughed off during digestion make it into the large intestine, also known as the colon. The body drains out most of the remaining fluid through the intestinal wall. What's left is a soft mass called stool. The colon squeezes this byproduct into a pouch called the rectum, where nerves sense it expanding, and tell the body when it's time to expel the waste. The byproducts of digestion exit through the anus, and the food's long journey, typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours, is finally complete. Ted Ed is a non-profit.

So let's talk about doping. You probably have heard of this thanks to Lance Armstrong, who secretly messed with his own blood so that he could illicitly win the Tour de France seven times in a row. You might be dimly familiar with the fact that doping isn't like shooting steroids, but it is still cheating, even though, like, why is it cheating and how does it work, and is it even possible to make your blood better at being blood? In other words, how can some people treat or mistreat their own blood like it's some sort of drug? Short answer, because your blood is incredibly powerful stuff. And its power rests largely in your erythrocytes, or red blood cells. They're the most abundant type of cell in your blood, accounting for nearly 45% of its volume. Every time you take a breath, they pick up oxygen in your lungs and distribute it through your body, and then grab carbon dioxide and bring it back to the lungs where it can be exhaled. of erythrocytes is to keep your body fed with oxygen so your muscles can do their thing and your brain can continue to think and feel and boss around your various parts. But you don't want to mess around with your red blood cells because erythrocytes are weird characters. They go places that other cells won't. They purge themselves of their most precious inner belongings, preferring instead to live as hollow shells. Because of the crushing demands of their job, they don't live very long and just like with your blood pressure, too much of these good things can turn bad quickly. So the erythrocyte must be respected. It is not for doping or for dopes. [\u266a INTRO MUSIC PLAYING...] Despite their prominent role in some international sports candles, your red blood cells are fairly simple and unassuming little cells. They've got a distinct biconcave shape, which just means that their concave on both sides make them look kind of like a breath mint. tiny, bloody breath mint. And while they do have a plasma membrane, they don't have a nucleus, and don't have most of the parts that other cells do. So they're basically just glorified, protein-filled, phospholipid bilayer sacs. But there's still another great example of that harmony between form and function. For one thing, that biconcave shape gives them a large surface area that's ideal for gas exchange. It also makes them flexible and able to change shape as they squeeze through tiny capillaries with diameters smaller than the cell itself. Of course, all that squeezing and twisting is hard on a cell's membrane, and that, combined with their general lack of organelles to help repair the membrane, means these cells don't live very long, surviving on average only 120 days. But they sure work hard while they're alive. And their work is mostly in gathering and transporting oxygen. They're able to do this because if you don't count their water content, red blood cells are 97% hemoglobin, a molecule that easily binds to and releases oxygen. It's like an oxygen sponge. Every hemoglobin molecule is really made of eight different component molecules. Four are a red pigment called heme, and four are a protein called, you guessed it, globin. Each globin is a globular polypeptide chain, hence its name, and proteins, you'll probably remember, like to bind to stuff. So each globin has its own, personal, ring-shaped heme molecule, and in the center of that heme is an iron atom, kind of like a cherry on top of a protein in pigment sundae. It's that iron in the center of the heme that makes our blood red. Incidentally, not all animals have red blood, because not all animals use hemoglobin to move oxygen. For example, most mollusks, like squids and snails, have blue blood because it contains hemosyanin, a copper-rich protein pigment that turns blue when exposed to oxygen. But iron is what we're stuck with, and I have to say it's great at its job, because each iron can bind with one whole oxygen molecule. And that oxygen really adds up. Since you have four iron atoms in every molecule of hemoglobin, and in every red blood cell contain something like 250 million hemoglobin molecules, that means that each one of your tiny floppy red breath mints can grab about a billion molecules of oxygen. Exactly how they transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide from your tissue cells is something that we'll get into more when we talk about the respiratory system. But if you're wondering why all this hemoglobin can't simply skip the red blood cell rigamarole and just run around naked in your blood, it's because free-range hemoglobin would actually thicken the blood, making it so viscous that it would impede blood flow. This also happens to play a part in blood doping, which stick with me, I will explain in a bit. So what does the brief but glorious four month life of an erythrocyte look like? Well, remember when I said that a red blood cell doesn't have a nucleus, and maybe you thought, hey, wait a second, how can it even be a cell without a nucleus or DNA? First of all, nice catch. But actually, erythrocytes do start off with a nucleus and DNA. They just get rid of them because their entire purpose for existing is to schlep around hemoglobin and oxygen, and they want the extra room. The whole process of forming red blood cells, called hematopoiesis, happens in your red bone marrow, which is mostly made of reticular connective tissue that's snuggled up to special capillaries called blood sinusoids. In short, the process begins with a hemocytoblast, or a specialized stem cell, which soon differentiates into an early erythroblast. Then it starts making a whole bunch of ribosomes, the organelles that manufacture proteins. And in this case, the ribosomes start cooking up tons of hemoglobin, as the cell transforms into a late-stage erythroblast. When it's got enough hemoglobin, it suddenly jettisons most of its organelles, which causes the cell walls to collapse a little, giving it its biconcave, bloody breathment shape. Now you're left with a reticulus site, which is pretty much just an early erythrocyte that still has a little group of ribosomes left called a reticulum. So far, this whole journey has taken about 15 days. When the reticulocyte is finally just about bursting with hemoglobin, then it leaves the marrow and enters the bloodstream. And a couple of days later, when the last of the ribosomes have degraded, you've officially got yourself a mature, red blood cell. And that cell travels around your body, doing its job for a few months before it gets old or damaged and needs to be replaced. Now, maintaining the balance between production and destruction of these cells is crucial. Too many will make the blood too viscous and difficult to pump, and too few leads to oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia. The process of maintaining the right levels of red blood cells is regulated by a special hormone called erythropoietin, or EPO. It's produced mostly in the kidneys, but also in the liver, and is constantly circulating in the blood. If you're anemic, or hiking at high altitude, or hemorrhaging blood, or experiencing anything else that creates a drop in your blood oxygen levels, certain cells in your kidney will take notice and take action. And they can do that because they traffic in a signaling molecule called hypoxia-inducible factor, which monitors your blood's levels of oxygen. So whether this works is pretty cool. These special kidney cells need oxygen in order to break down that signaling molecule. So if oxygen levels in the blood are low, they can't turn the signal off. This means that the signal keeps going, which triggers the release of more and more EPO, which stimulates your red bone marrow to pump out more red blood cells to carry around more oxygen. As oxygen levels in your blood increase, the signal is degraded, and EPO production slows. And EPO is a key player in blood-doping, too, but we're going to have to wait a minute before we get there, because I first want to get back to the fate of your hardworking erythrocytes. So if you're generating around two million new blood cells every second, you also have to dispose of about the same number of dead ones to maintain the balance, right? When these cells get old, they turn rigid and their hemoglobin start to fall apart. As they get stiffer, they can end up getting stuck in capillaries in your brain or heart, which would not be good. Luckily, you have certain channels to corral these dying cells, especially around the spleen, which some anatomists call the red blood cell graveyard. So these tired old cells get trapped and then basically ambushed by big macrophage white blood cells in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, which break them down and recycle their various components. The globin proteins are broken down into their basic components, amino acids, which go back into the blood to be used by other cells for making more proteins. Iron from the heme group is separated and either bound to proteins and stored in the liver, or put right back into a new hemoglobin molecule. And the heme gets turned into bilirubin, a yellowish pigment that goes to the liver where it's added to the bile that it secretes into the intestine, and eventually leaves the body in your poop. Now that you know how your erythrocytes function naturally, it's easier to see how they can be messed with, often with bad results. You can dope your blood in a few different ways, but the most common technique is to inject natural or synthetic EPO hormone to boost your red blood cell production. It's also possible to draw and store some of your own blood, and then transfuse it back into your body after it's recovered from the blood loss, effectively raising your volume of red blood cells. The logic, if you can call it that, is that more red blood cells equals more oxygen being carried to your muscles, and therefore better physical performance. Now, the extra oxygen can't change your actual muscle strength, but the adductorobic capacity does reduce muscle fatigue and enhance endurance by allowing your muscles to work harder for longer. provide enough of an extra edge to win a race, like say the Tour de France. Seven times. But not only is it banned in athletic competitions, blood doping is also dangerous. Because remember, a red blood cell count that's too high thickens the blood, and that actually makes it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. In addition to defeating the purpose of enhancing the blood's effectiveness, this can lead to blood clots and strokes and heart failure. So no thank you. Plus, cheating sucks. But today you learned about the structure and function of your erythrocytes and of hemoglobin, which they use to carry oxygen. We also went through the formation and life cycle of a red blood cell and studied how their levels are regulated by EPO and their signaling molecules. Finally, we learned how doping the blood is a recipe for disaster and for finding yourself on Oprah and apologizing to everyone you know and losing all of your yellow jerseys.

It takes a heavy toll on both patients and families, as caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's can be emotionally overwhelming and financially difficult. While doctors have studied Alzheimer's for decades, conducting hundreds of clinical trials, there is still no effective preventive treatment or cure. So why is Alzheimer's disease so difficult to treat? Alzheimer's accounts for 60 to 80% of all dementia patients worldwide. Dementia is a broader term used to describe a variety of conditions that affect a patient's memory, thinking skills, and everyday functions. Most Alzheimer's patients first notice symptoms in their 60s, experiencing mild memory problems, like losing track of dates or forgetting what they just learned. Some experience other changes, like frequent shifts in mood, increased anxiety and agitation, and problems with coping in new situations. Symptoms typically progress gradually over years, and eventually a person with Alzheimer's may require constant care. Some rare forms of Alzheimer's are caused by a single inherited gene variant. But most of the time, Alzheimer's is due to the complex interaction of multiple genes, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. So it's impossible to predict who will develop the disease. Alzheimer's involves a long chronic process, resulting in many changes to the brain that likely starts to unfold at least one to two decades before symptoms first appear. So it's been difficult for scientists to pinpoint exactly what triggers this process and what causes the many symptoms of Alzheimer's. But thanks to continued research, they're beginning to put this puzzle together. Initially, scientists noticed that the brains of Alzheimer's patients display an abnormal buildup of a compound called beta-amyloid. Beta amyloid is created when a large protein, amyloid beta precursor protein, or APP, is broken down. APP plays an essential role in the brain, aiding in neural growth and repair. However, in Alzheimer's patients, it's thought that APP is improperly cleaved, creating sticky beta-amyloid byproducts, which easily clump together. These plaques can build up in the spaces between neurons and interfere with normal brain signaling. But this likely isn't the full story. While all patients with Alzheimer's have plaques, not all people with plaques have or will develop dementia. And Alzheimer's symptoms don't always become more severe as plaques accumulate in the brain. In the 1980s, another protein, tau, emerged as a possible contributor. Tau's normal role is as a scaffolding protein to help reinforce the internal structure of neurons and give them their shape. But in Alzheimer's patients, tau is modified and misfolded, causing it, like beta-amyloid, to become sticky and to clump. These tau tangles accumulate within neurons and are toxic, causing the cells to eventually die. Inpatients plaques normally appear before tangles, yet questions still remain. Do amyloid plaques trigger tau dysfunction? And why exactly do these abnormal proteins lead to such specific disease symptoms? To make matters more complex, recent studies have found that Alzheimer's is closely linked to changes in the way immune cells, called microglia, function in the brain. Others have found that Alzheimer's may also be caused by problems in the junctions between neurons, called synapses. And alterations in the way the brain produces and burns energy may also be an underlying factor. Together, all this suggests that Alzheimer's is likely caused by a complex cascade of events. and teasing out the order of events and how to stop it once it starts will take more research. But there are things patients can do to better manage symptoms. Staying active, learning new skills, and even participating in daily activities like household chores seems to slow disease progression. Medications that target neurotransmitters, the brain's signaling molecules, can slow memory loss and help with learning and reasoning. And scientists continue to develop new therapies. For example, drugs that target beta amyloid have shown promise in slowing the disease and reducing plaque accumulation in the brain. Alzheimer's disease won't go away anytime soon. Dementia cases are expected to double in the next 20 years. But continued research holds the promise of better treatment, and perhaps one day, prevention. as scientists piece the Alzheimer's puzzle together. What if your brain could regenerate itself, updating its own damaged cells? This might sound like science fiction, but it's actually something scientists are seriously looking into.

Characterized as a major form of dementia, Alzheimer's typically manifests in individuals during their 60s with early symptoms such as mild memory loss and mood fluctuations. The disease's complexity stems from a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors, making it unpredictable and challenging to treat. Research has identified key proteins involved in the disease's progression, notably beta-amyloid and tau. Beta-amyloid forms sticky plaques that disrupt neuronal communication, while tau misfolds into tangles that are toxic to neurons. Despite the presence of these proteins, the relationship between their accumulation and the severity of symptoms remains unclear. Recent studies also suggest that immune cell dysfunction and synaptic issues may contribute to Alzheimer's pathology.

We've harnessed electricity, sequenced the human genome, and eradicated smallpox. But after billions of dollars in research, we haven't found a solution for a disease that affects more than 14 million people and their families at any given time. arises as normal cells accumulate mutations. Most of the time, cells can detect mutations or DNA damage and either fix them or self-destruct. However, some mutations allow cancerous cells to grow unchecked and invade nearby tissues or even metastasize to distant organs. Cancers become almost incurable once they metastasize. And cancer is incredibly complex. It's not just one disease. There are more than 100 different types, and we don't have a magic bullet that can cure all of them. For most cancers, treatments usually include a combination of surgery to remove tumors, and radiation and chemotherapy to kill any cancerous cells left behind. Hormone therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted treatments tailored for a specific type of cancer are sometimes used too. In many cases, these treatments are effective and the patient becomes cancer-free. But they're very far from 100% effective 100% of the time. So what would we have to do to find cures for all the different forms of cancer? We're beginning to understand a few of the problems scientists would have to solve. First of all, We need new, better ways of studying cancer. Most cancer treatments are developed using cell lines grown in labs from cultures of human tumors. These cultured cells have given us critical insights about cancer genetics and biology, but they lack much of the complexity of a tumor in an actual living organism. It's frequently the case that new drugs which work on these lab-grown cells will fail in clinical trials with real patients. One of the complexities of aggressive tumors is that they can have multiple populations of slightly different cancerous cells. Over time, distinct genetic mutations accumulate in cells in different parts of the tumor, giving rise to unique subclones. For example, aggressive brain tumors called glioblastomas can have as many as six different subclones in a single patient. This is called clonal heterogeneity, and it makes treatment difficult because a drug that works on one subclone may have no effect on another. Here's another challenge. A tumor is a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem where cancer cells constantly communicate with each other and with healthy cells nearby. They can induce normal cells to form blood vessels that feed the tumor and remove waste products. They can also interact with the immune system to actually suppress its function, keeping it from recognizing or destroying the cancer. If we could learn how to shut down these lines of communication, we'd have a better shot at vanquishing a tumor permanently. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests we'll need to figure out how to eradicate cancer stem cells. These are rare but seem to have special properties that make them resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. In theory, even if the rest of the tumor shrinks beyond detection during treatment, a single residual cancer stem cell could seed the growth of a new tumor. Figuring out how to target these stubborn cells might help prevent cancers from coming back. Even if we solved those problems, we might face new ones. Cancer cells are masters of adaptation, adjusting their molecular and cellular characteristics to survive under stress. When they're bombarded by radiation or chemotherapy, some cancer cells can effectively switch on protective shields against whatever is attacking them by changing their gene expression. Malignant cancers are complex systems that constantly evolve and adapt. To defeat them, we need to find experimental systems that match their complexity and monitoring and treatment options that can adjust as the cancer changes. But the good news is, we're making progress. Even with all we don't know, the average mortality rate for most kinds of cancer has dropped significantly since the 1970s and is still falling. We're learning more every day, and each new piece of information gives us one more tool to add to our arsenal. History repeats, but science reverberates.

Cancer arises when normal cells accumulate mutations, leading to unchecked growth and potential metastasis, which complicates treatment. With over 100 types of cancer, a one-size-fits-all solution is unattainable. Current treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, are effective for some patients but not universally. One major hurdle is the complexity of tumors, which often consist of diverse populations of cancer cells, known as clonal heterogeneity. This diversity means that therapies targeting one cell type may fail against another. Additionally, tumors function as dynamic ecosystems, communicating with surrounding healthy cells and evading immune detection, further complicating treatment strategies. \n\nTo improve outcomes, researchers are exploring better methods for studying cancer, including more sophisticated models that mimic the tumor environment. Targeting cancer stem cells, which contribute to recurrence, and understanding how cancer cells adapt to therapies are also critical areas of focus. Despite these challenges, progress is being made, and the average cancer mortality rate has been declining, indicating that ongoing research may eventually lead to more effective treatments and potential cures for various cancer types.", "channel": "TED-Ed"}

Being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma last year gave me some insight into how scary cancer can be, but also how fascinating cancer and its various treatments are. SciShow has explored these diseases, and cancer is many diseases, not one, from every possible angle. Testing, treatment, causes, prevention, even some research on a cancer fighting gecko named Mr. Frosty. We have gathered these videos together to highlight how much progress we are making in our quest to understand cancer. I personally found that understanding my disease and my treatment helped me feel more at peace with what I was going through. I want maybe a little further than most would go. This is a selection of books I have read in the last year, for example. I found it comforting, I promise. We're all going to deal with cancer in one way or another throughout our lives. And I obviously believe that taking it on with careful understanding is the way to go. So here's a very long video with a lot of cancer science. [\u266a INTRO MUSIC PLAYING!] Chemotherapy sucks. By all accounts, it's basically poison. It interferes with stuff in your own cells in the hopes that it will kill the cancer before it kills you. While it works, and it definitely works, doctors generally are not fond of putting patients through its gauntlet of side effects. And they're actually making steady progress towards not doing that. So here's a look at why we use chemo, some of the new options we can use instead, and how cancer treatment is getting better and smarter all the time. [\u266a INTRO Music Plays<|ru|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|> To be absolutely clear, chemotherapy works. To be absolutely clear, chemotherapy works. That's why we use it so much. It's why we use it so much. It's most basic, chemotherapy, or chemo for short, is just using drugs to treat cancer. Between 2013 and 2020, about one in five cancerous tumors in England\u2014that is, more than half a million of the suckers\u2014got treated with some form of chemotherapy. One thing that's important to keep in mind is that chemo comes in many shapes and sizes. There are hundreds of different cancer drugs out there, and patients will get one or a combination of different drugs depending on their circumstances. Sometimes the idea is to make the cancer go away completely, while other times the chemo helps to make other treatments like surgery more effective. And sometimes, the goal is to simply manage symptoms when a cure isn't possible. But cures do happen. Newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular cancer, and acute lymphocytic leukemia can all be treated with chemotherapy with the expectation that, in most patients, the cancer goes away for good. If you want an example that I am intimately familiar with, one common drug is called doxorubicin, which is sometimes combined with three other drugs with similarly difficult-to-pronounce names into a cocktail called ABVD. Without going too deep into it, doxorubicin is good at killing dividing cells. Because normally, that nucleus is a tangled mess of DNA, and it uses an enzyme called topoisomerase as like a molecular detangling spray. The cell needs to detangle its DNA in order to shrink down those neat little chromosomes and divide, which it can't do without its detangling spray, which doxorubicin blocks. So that's why doxorubicin targets mostly cancer cells, but also can affect other cells that like to divide. This is a common problem with chemo drugs. We want to target the cancer cells. The cancer cells, on a molecular level, look very similar to the rest of you. But one thing almost all cancers have in common is that they grow and divide quickly. So a lot of chemo drugs target various growth and division mechanisms. Unfortunately, that means that they can do a fair amount of collateral damage, especially to cells that have to replicate a lot for their normal jobs, like growing hair, replacing the stomach lining, or creating immune cells. So while I can tell you from personal experience that chemotherapy is miserable, it also has done amazing things for me personally, and I'm extremely grateful for all of the different drugs in ABVD. But if we can do better, we'd like doing better. There are at least two important avenues of research for better, less regular cell death-inducing treatments, targeted and personalized therapies. Right now, most chemo drugs go in your arm or into your stomach, and then everywhere in your body, which is how they get to your stomach lining and hair follicles, etc. But targeted therapies are designed to more specifically go after the cancer, leaving the non-cancerous cells alone. Some of these are so-called small molecule drugs that target different parts of a tumor's growth cycle. The term refers to small molecules that you would recognize as similar to traditional drugs like aspirin or penicillin. By interfering with molecular processes that only cancer cells have, they can spare a patient some of the harmful side effects of regular chemotherapy. One of the earliest success stories in this space is a drug called imatinib, which is used for some leukemias. These leukemias have a ridiculously specific mutation, known as BCR-ABL. It happens when two different chromosomes get stuck together in one exact place, sending levels of a certain cellular growth signal into the stratosphere. And that mutation is only in the cancer, and not in the patient's healthy cells. Imatinib shuts that growth signal back down. This method of stopping messages that are specific to a cancer is promising. In fact, a 2018 review estimated about 150 drugs in the same vein as imatinib were in clinical trials, plus countless others that work in other ways. But good, small molecule drugs are hard to make, because you need to know a lot about the molecular processes of cancer that you are trying to treat. And then, once you've got something that works for one cancer, there's no guarantee that it will work for even a slightly different disease. Luckily, biology gives us an even better tool for targeting a specific thing. Monoclonal antibodies are another major category of targeted therapy. You may have noticed that a lot of newer cancer drugs have this fancy MAB suffix, like Trastuzumab, and Pembrolizumab, and Rituximab. These are all monoclonal antibodies. They come to us courtesy of our own immune system. They are those Y-shaped molecules that normally stick to viruses and other invaders. But with a little science, we can convince them to stick to pretty much anything we'd like. The monoclonal bit on the antibody just means all the ones given in a batch are the same, and stick to the same thing. In general, monoclonal antibodies do one of three things in cancer treatment. They block cancer cells from growing, or they flag the cells to the immune system as baddies, or they deliver harmful chemicals into the cell. Trastuzumab, for example, attaches to a protein found on some cancers called HER2. When cancers have these proteins, they have a lot of them. And they help the cancer grow and divide. So by blocking them, Trastuzumab stops this growth. On the other hand, pembrolizumab is designed to attach to proteins on your immune cells and supercharge them to better identify and eliminate cancer cells. Since this strategy recruits your immune system, it's also known as immunotherapy. Now, another big area of research right now is in personalized therapy. That's because no-two cancers are exactly alike, and no-two people have the exact same genetic background. If you have a mutated version of the genes called BRCA1 or BRCA2, you are significantly more likely to develop breast cancer in your life. It's now way easier and cheaper than it ever was before to test early on to find out if you're at risk because of your genetics. Then, you can do something about it, either by just being more aware and then screening more often, or by choosing preemptive therapy. More than that, knowing if you have these genes can also impact the best treatment for you if you do develop cancer. For example, a big cancer drug trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2021 found that cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are more susceptible to a type of drug called a PARP inhibitor. And that's not all we can do to individualize treatment. In fact, we don't even need to move beyond breast cancer for another example. Some breast cancers have receptors for estrogen, and some don't. Those with estrogen receptors respond to drugs that block them, like tamoxifen. But those drugs won't work if your cancer doesn't have those receptors to begin with. The same thing happens with receptors for progesterone, and also for HER2. We have drugs to target any of the three. A triple negative breast cancer doesn't have any of those three receptors, and tends to be the hardest to treat. On the flip side, though, we can do tests to find that out, and that can help doctors develop the patient's treatment plan. Or warned is forarmed. If we can better understand, at a molecular level, not only the cancer, but the person it's growing in, we can use exactly the right drug in exactly the right place. Chemotherapy is not going anywhere in the next five, ten, or twenty years. In fact, some targeted therapies just deliver the exact same old chemo drugs right to the tumor, like a little side effect of voiding Uber driver. But we're developing more better arrows to have in our quiver to keep people not only alive but feeling better. And that is something to feel very good about. There's currently no simple way to diagnose cancer. Cancer is a lot of different things, and there's just no way to develop one single straightforward test where doctors like prick your finger and a machine goes, yep, that's cancer. Except, one day, there might be, thanks to a gene that doesn't do anything. See, cancer is prone to turning on this one weird genetic sequence that's widely considered junk. It doesn't do much of anything for our bodies, even though it does make cancer worse. But one team of researchers is on the trail of this genetic interloper. And by finding it, they think they can find cancer. As in, in general. Here's how. [\u266a INTRO MUSIC PLAYING! ?] Meet the genetic snippet known as Long Interspersed Nuclear Element 1, or Line 1, for short. It doesn't do much. Junk DNA is thought to be like stuff that takes up space but has no useful function. And far less of our DNA is junk than scientists used to believe. But Line 1 takes up space and has no useful function. It's grade A certified spam. Line 1 is a retro-transposon, a 6,000-ish-letter sequence of genetic material that replicates by making RNA copies of itself and wandering all over the genome, inserting itself inside strands of DNA. This sequence makes a couple of proteins, called ORF1P and ORF2P, which have the extremely important jobs of copying the Line 1 sequence and pasting it elsewhere. And that is all Line 1 does. Control-C, Control-V. I do want to point out that a molecular biologist calling a protein Orph 1P is like calling it protein McProteinface, as generic as it could possibly get. This cut-and-paste tomfoolery accounts for 17% of our genome, and yet it contributes absolutely diddly squat in terms of gene function. Every once in a while, an optimistic paper comes out assigning some helpful function to Line 1, but it's optimistic. Some researchers have gone as far as to characterize retro-transposons like line 1 as genomic parasites. The body just needs a pretty enthusiastic watchdog to keep these things in line. Transposons happen in a lot of organisms. Scientists think that at some point, there must have been a really good reason for a genetic sequence whose only function was to cut and paste itself. But if there used to be a good reason, it is not super-evident now. Under most circumstances, these traveling sequences do nothing but clog up your chromosomes. That's a big source of stress for cells, and can even cause disease. For instance, if line 1 cuts into the middle of a gene, it can break that gene entirely. If a gene is a set of instructions, and you put a totally different set of instructions in the middle of that set of instructions, it's going to get pretty garbled. It's actually been shown that line 1 budding in ungenes that make blood clotting proteins can break the blood clotting process and cause hemophilia. As a result, healthy cells don't usually give line 1 much opportunity to do its thing. and they silence it in a few different ways, including by attaching chemical compounds called methyl groups to line 1 elements. This is a common strategy that cells use to turn down genetic material they're not using. A brain cell doesn't need to make insulin, right? Leave that to the pancreas. And since nobody needs to make line 1, everybody shuts it up. Here's the fun thing, though. Line 1 is allowed to turn back on in about 50% of all human cancers. Researchers don't really know why, But cancer cells do like to throw away all those little methyl group flags that keep genes silenced. Maybe they just benefit from the chaos. Whatever the reason, line 1, in particular, nearly always seems to lose its methyl groups. Which gives it the ability to turn back on \u2014 and the absolutely nothing it does \u2014 can lead to genetic chaos. Like in colon cancer, activated line 1 is sometimes shown to be stuck in the middle of a tumor-suppressing gene called APC, breaking it, just like with hemophilia. Other studies show that by inserting itself into DNA, line 1 causes a bunch of breaks in that twisty backbone. That compromises the genome's overall stability, and that damage might aid tumor growth. Research also suggests that line 1 expression is related to damage to the tumor-suppressing P53 protein that regulates cell division and suppresses tumor growth in the body. In other words, line 1 can cause an awful lot of mischief for some supposedly harmless genetic junk mail. Just by doing its cut-and-paste thing, it's tilting the odds in cancer's favor. Even if a cancer wasn't looking to turn on line 1, so to speak, a cancer that does do that, just by chance, might have a better time. And so it goes that line 1 expression seems to be associated with basically half of the cancers, including ones like ovarian and gastroesophageal cancer that are often hard to diagnose because they keep a low profile symptom-wise until they're too advanced to easily treat. Others of the esophagus, colon, lung, breast, prostate, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, head, and neck all seem to fire up in concert with the Line 1 garbage machine. But here's the amazing thing. It just so happens that if Line 1 is making Orph 1P, one of the proteins that carry it around, it's pretty easy to detect it in the blood. In a 2023 paper, researchers presented a super-sensitive machine that can look for Orph 1P in our blood plasma. In fact, the method works on as little as a half a drop of blood. The researchers found that the test was extremely accurate in detecting a wide range of cancers. They claim the test itself has a turnaround of just a couple of hours, and costs less than $3 to produce. Imagine a procedure no more complicated than the finger sticks used to monitor blood sugar and diabetes. That's what we might be looking at in the future. Of course, this test cannot tell your doctor where in the body the cancer is hiding. Only that ORF1P is present, so you probably got cancer somewhere and more tests are needed. That means it's a simple first-line screen that's easy to get to patients, not something to replace something more sophisticated like a PET scan. However, this test could also be used to monitor whether treatments are working. If a certain treatment is effective, doctors should be able to see blood levels of ORF1P dropping. Line 1 might be a couch-surfing, freeloading, cancer-helping genetic parasite, but its one redeeming quality seems to be that it's not crafty enough to hide its antics. In fact, it may end up snitching on the very cancers it is aiding. Finally, it's doing something worthwhile. Doctors have a huge collection of tools, tests, and procedures to diagnose many known conditions. But when something unknown comes up, it's a race against time to figure out what's going on. A new condition may affect many people, or just a few, or in the rarest cases, only one. Yet, it's still important to get them care, even in the most extraordinary circumstances, both to help them and anyone else who develops the condition, unlikely as it may be. Which is why doctors and pathologists, the scientists who study disease, had to crack the mystery of the patient with the rarest cancer ever seen. A cancer that, as far as we know, has only ever happened once. The patient was a 41-year-old man in Colombia, and the cancer technically wasn't even human. The malignant masses of cells in his lymph nodes originally came from a tapeworm. But they didn't look like tapeworms, or act like tapeworms. So it took about five months for the patient's doctors in Columbia and researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to puzzle out what was going on. Let's look at the case from the beginning. In January 2013, the patient presented with a fever, cough, fatigue, and weight loss. He had been diagnosed with HIV in 2006. There are therapies available to manage HIV infections, but the patient was not taking any medication when he presented. By 2013, the HIV infection had taken a toll on his immune system. This can be measured in two ways\u2014the amount of virus or viral load in the blood, and the number of immune cells called CD4 cells, also present in the blood. HIV destroys CD4 cells, so as viral load goes up, CD4 counts go down. The patient's viral load was about 70,000 per milliliter, where 100,000 is considered severe. His CD4 count was 28 per cubic millimeter, where below 200 indicates severe infection. The doctors checked for other infections and found evidence of parasites, including hymenolepsis nana, better known as dwarf tapeworm. Dwarf tapeworm is the most common tapeworm infection. It affects about 75 million people around the world, and it has one trick that makes it particularly nasty. Unlike most parasites, which need to live in a couple different organisms throughout their life cycles, dwarf tapeworms can spend their whole lives and reproduce in the human small intestine. But there was one other thing that caught the doctor's attention. The man had clumps of cells up to 4.5 centimeters across, growing in his lungs, his liver, near his kidneys, and in his lymph nodes. In many ways, the clumps seemed a lot like cancer. Under a microscope, the cells in the clump all looked like copies of each other, a sure sign of uncontrolled cell growth. And they were growing in places where they obviously didn't fit in, much like malignant cancer cells that can spread through the body and take root in new places. Each clump of cells was densely packed and unorganized, like the cells were growing and and dividing super fast without any particular function. The cells also had large nuclei, which is common in stem cells, cells that, somewhat like cancer cells, are able to keep growing and dividing, that also pointed towards something malignant. The clumps of cells had other features that stopped the team from calling it cancer outright. First, the cells were smaller than most human cancer cells. And when the researchers specifically looked for human cytokiratin and vimentin, proteins that usually show up in human cancers, they didn't find any. The researchers started brainstorming. Maybe it's a slime mold, or amoebas, or something infectious. But they ruled those ideas out one by one. While they ran a DNA test for slime molds and fungi, they received an unexpected result \u2014 dwarf tapeworm DNA, with a 99% match. The team double and triple checked their results because these cell clumps looked nothing like tapeworms, and they were far outside the tapeworm's usual territory in the intestinal tract. But remember, the patient did have a tapeworm infection. So the question became, how did it turn to cancer? A close look at the whole DNA sequence of that tapeworm infection revealed significant mutations in at least five proteins. Three of those proteins had known equivalents in mammals, and those had previously been tied to cancer. So the tapeworm had developed mutations likely related to cancer, and the masses of cells looked like cancer in every sense, except for the part where they were tapeworm cells. Leading the doctors to conclude that the clumps were malignant cancer-like masses that originated in tapeworms. It took the research team five months to make the diagnosis. By that time, the patient's condition had deteriorated. He gave permission for scientists to study his condition and publish the results. Three days after DNA analysis confirmed the diagnosis, he died of kidney failure. It took a few more years for the team to finish analyzing the case and publish their results. The question remained, how do tapeworm cells spread around a person's body? Scientists think that because HIV had depleted the man's immune system, the tapeworm population in his gut mutated so much that it could move beyond the small intestine. One of the researchers speculated that the masses started out as regular tapeworm larvae. But being in the lungs or lymph nodes and not the intestine that they're adapted to, they matured out of control into these cancer-like clumps instead of adult tapeworms. The good news is that the researchers don't expect this to be a common result of a tapeworm infection. There are effective treatment options available for tapeworm infections, and there are antiretroviral therapies that can lower an HIV infection to an undetectable level for those with access to that care. And while the researchers don't necessarily expect this to happen again, they do suggest that if it does, it could go misidentified. But now that there's a well-documented case, doctors caring for patients in similar circumstances will know to look extra closely at cancer-like lumps. If tapeworms are to blame, then the doctors can start working on the next question, what kind of treatment will help these patients? Is there anything microwaves can't do? They'll bring your day old spaghetti back to life, heat up your queso in a matter of seconds. Also, they might help relieve pain and cure some cancers. That's a pretty neat trick as well. A new technology called microwave ablation is raising hopes that microwaves could soon be used not just to destroy existing tumors, but also to stop new ones from forming in the first place. Mmm. Microwaves seem to belong squarely in the kitchen, but they've actually been used in medicine for a pretty long time. And they seem a little bit magic, so here's how they work. A microwave is a type of electromagnetic radiation, like visible light, or radio waves, or x-rays. It's got a specific wavelength from 1 millimeter to 1 meter. Microwaves carry more energy than, say, the 3 meter radio waves that carry tunes for FM radio, but less energy than nanometer-sized x-rays. And if you can make these waves and then change their direction very quickly, then polar molecules, with a negative end and a positive end will try to keep up. Water is just such a molecule, and it gets really agitated in the presence of oscillating microwaves. But non-polar materials like ceramics, plastics, and bones aren't really bothered. This can be annoying when you are trying to reheat something that doesn't respond well to microwaves, but it will become important later. Remember that it is only water and other polar molecules that react to these oscillating microwaves. In the 1920s, magnetrons were invented that could make powerful microwaves, and they were greatly improved in the 40s. And that was very useful for applications like radar. But also, it turns out, medicine. Soon, doctors began investigating how microwaves could be used for healing. And from the very first studies, it was clear that by heating tissues, you could increase blood flow. And that had all sorts of benefits, not least of which was pain relief. One theory is that increased blood flow increases all the good stuff flowing to the area. Muscles and other tissues love oxygen, nutrients, and cells that specialize in repairing damage. The blood brings all those things right where they need to go. And bonus, the increased blood flow also increases the rate at which bad stuff gets washed away. And so, microwave diathermy, the fancy medical term for heating somebody up with microwaves, It is sometimes used to treat muscle and bone issues like shoulder injuries, knee problems, and tendon issues. But it's basically just a way to get heat to an area. It's the heat that does the healing. As the technology developed, doctors were able to better target the exact area they needed to, and by using cooling pads to keep the skin cool, they could keep the heat where it was needed without causing damage. It wasn't too long until another group of doctors started getting interested in microwaves, oncologists. Forest doctors usually try to keep temperatures in these situations in the low 40s Celsius, because any higher than that and the proteins start denaturing and cells start to die. And that sounds bad. It's usually bad. Unless cell death is what you're after. Because cells, of course, tend to be full of water, they are very susceptible to microwaves. But just placing somebody in a giant microwave oven would cook all of their cells, so oncologists have to be a lot more precise. Instead, they insert a tiny probe that creates microwave radiation around the end of the probe. It heats up only the nearby cells and can be very accurately controlled. This method is called microwave ablation, and it's gaining traction in oncology as a reliable way to kill cancerous tumors, especially in the liver. Cutting out a tumor with surgery is probably the most straightforward treatment, but it turns out that cutting out liver tumors is really hard. The majority of liver tumors are actually inoperable. That could be for a few different reasons. It might be that the tumor is too close to major blood vessels, because it's spread too much in the liver already, or because the person isn't otherwise healthy enough to go through a surgery. The liver is also a common place for cancers to spread to, also known as metastasis, because so much of your blood passes through it on a daily basis. So here is how microwave ablation for a liver tumor usually works. First, doctors insert a small needle with a microwave antenna at the end into the liver, and they guide it directly into the tumor. Then, they turn on the microwave generator, and the tip of the antenna causes a field that heats up nearby tissue. By precisely controlling how long the antenna is on, and how much power is delivered, the doctors can precisely control how big the affected area gets. Typically, they will aim to destroy the entire tumor and one centimeter around it in all directions just to be safe. Microwave ablation is effective, and more and more cancer centers are turning to this technology. The newer advance is the combination of microwave ablation with magnetic nanoparticles. By injecting tiny pieces of material, like metals or carbon nanotubes, into the tumor first, it can make the microwaves even more effective. Think of it kind of like strategically putting metal in the microwave to get those sparks exactly where you need them. Another booster for microwave ablation might be the immune system itself. In a study published in 2021, researchers found that the immune system of patients who had MWA for their early-stage breast cancer actually showed the markers of being better equipped to fight the cancer. In another 2020 study in mice, researchers showed that mice with metastatic breast cancer had better survival rates after being treated with microwave ablation than with surgery. So here's the theory. In MWA, the charred remains of the tumor are left behind, and your immune system is able to learn what the tumor looked like. Compare that to surgery, which totally removes the enemy, along with any evidence your immune system can use if the cancer comes back. For some early-stage cancers, research is starting to show that microwave ablation is a viable option that may be better than surgery. Evidence is mounting that MWA is less invasive, causes less stress on the body, and can help the immune system. While microwaves are certainly an exciting avenue of treatment, it's important to remember that there is no silver bullet for cancer, because it is not just one disease. But for people with certain cancers, this treatment may give an extra edge and save more lives. Not bad for a technology you probably most associate with a frozen burrito. You may have heard that a major international health policy group has put in place some new warnings regarding artificial sweeteners and their potential to cause cancer. You may also be dragging your diet soda out to the curb. But before you do that, I'd like to walk you through a little context around this story. Short version, don't panic. In the future version, this new guidance is based on science, but it's not an open-and-shut case. And some observers say there's a whole 12-pack of issues here. On July 14th, the World Health Organization added aspartame to a list of things it considers possibly cancerous, and included a specific warning for liver cancer. We'll get into what that means in a minute, but let's start with the chemical itself. Aspartame is an artificial sweetener that was discovered by accident in 1968 and has been on the market since 1981. It's used in many kinds of diet soda and other artificially sweetened beverages and foods. Here in the US, the Food and Drug Administration remains convinced that aspartame is safe. That said, research into its safety has continued over the years. So let's get under the hood of this new decision. Perhaps the splashiest studies arguing against the use of aspartame came out in 2006. This pair of papers from the same research team found that rats that were given daily doses of aspartame had drastically increased rates of cancers of the blood and the nervous system. But even when these studies were published, other researchers argued that the researchers misdiagnosed what was wrong with the rats. See, these researchers diagnosed their rats posthumously, conducting netcropsies only when the rats died their natural deaths. This isn't the typical way that animal research is done. Often, you would raise the animal under the experimental conditions for a set amount of time, and then euthanize them to study. Letting them die of natural causes introduces the possibility that the health issues discovered in the netcropsy might have nothing to do with your experiment. And other groups argued that what the team identified as tumors were actually inflammation or signs of bacterial infection in the rats, not cancer. But even if it was cancer that killed these rats, there's another huge issue with this study, which is just how much aspartame these rats were dosed with every day. Food regulatory agencies like the FDA calculate what a safe daily intake of a given substance might be. The assumption is that the dose makes the poison. Even things that could theoretically be dangerous are usually fine in really small doses, So they define those really small doses and set limits on how much of that thing can be in any food product. For aspartame, the FDA's safety limit is 50 mg per kilogram of body weight. So for someone weighing about 68 kg, they'd need to consume over 3,400 mg of aspartame to exceed that limit. And since a can of Diet Coke contains a little under 200 mg of aspartame, that means you'd need to drink almost 18 cans per day to exceed that threshold. Some of the rats in this study were given doses of aspartame equivalent to a human consuming 5,000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, which is astronomically high. It's literally the equivalent of those rats drinking over 26 sodas a day, and not rat-sized sodas, regular 12-ounce ones. In the entire experiment, only two doses of aspartame that these rats were exposed to are below the FDA's acceptable limit. Another study by that same team looked at aspartame's effects on mice, and found that daily aspartame intake was correlated with increased rates of liver and lung cancers, but only in male mice. Aside from that, it's important to remember that humans are not rodents. So, the next step in figuring out whether aspartame might be related to health risks in humans is to follow a bunch of humans who consume it and just see what happens. And that's what's called a longitudinal study, where researchers take a large cohort of people, get their baseline data, and follow them over the course of several years to see what changes occur in their overall health. So in response to that RAT study, in 2006, a team of researchers at the American Association of Cancer Research published the results of their longitudinal study. It looked at adults who consumed varying amounts of aspartame and the rates at which they developed blood and nervous system cancers. The result? There was no correlation between the use of aspartame and cancer. And it's important to remember that this study was looking at people who consumed aspartame in a range of quantities. I mean, I've heard of people who drink a dozen diet pepsis a day, but that's not most people. But if these studies came out in 2006, why are we, in the World Health Organization, talking about this now? Well, it probably has to do with a paper that came out in 2022. Unlike the 2006 cohort study, this one found that consumption of aspartame was correlated to higher risks of breast cancer and cancers related to body weight. And this more recent study found that there was an increased risk of cancers just in general, with consumption of artificial sweeteners, which is both interesting and extremely vague. Remember, the new warning is for liver cancer. And there's one more layer to this artificial sweetener, onion. The way that the IARC, the WHO's cancer arm, classifies these risk factors is not the most intuitive. They have four rankings for how allegedly dangerous something is \u2014 carcinogenic, probably carcinogenic, possibly carcinogenic, and not classifiable. But the way that an item gets into any of those categories isn't based on the magnitude of the risk that the thing presents. All that matters is that there's a lot of papers suggesting a relationship between cancer and that thing, no matter how small that relationship is. In fact, in their own words, the evidence for aspartame causing cancer is limited. And for reference, some things in their probably cancerous category include red meat and working the night shift. Like, some of these warnings are simply not practical or feasible to bring into your daily life. Anyone who's ever had a newborn or pulled an all-nighter for school knows that you can't always ensure that a good night's sleep is going to happen. And those things are in the probably carcinogenic pile. Aspartame is going in the one below, the possibly group. So, like, eh. Meanwhile, the WHO also has a food safety committee, and they haven't changed their recommendation on the acceptable limit for aspartame intake. It's still 40 mg per kilogram of body weight, a smidge less than the FDA's. In any case, figuring out the exact relationship between any single factor and cancer is not easy. And while the WHO may be changing their recommendations, the FDA does not look like they will update guidance here in the US anytime soon. So should you throw away all your diet beverages? Well, probably not. I have it on good authority that at least one diet cherry, Dr. Pepper, was consumed during the development of this episode. These are decisions that everyone has to make on their own, and bodies like the WHO can only try to provide guidance. So I'll just say it again, don't panic. Finding a cure for cancer is basically the holy grail of medicine. There have been countless studies aimed at treating different types of cancer, and they've seriously improved the odds of beating this disease. But one thing that gets a lot less research attention is how to reduce the risk of cancer in the first place. And there's definitely some evidence for individual strategies to reduce cancer risk. You've heard of some of these, like, don't smoke. But in a study published this week in Frontiers in Aging, researchers explored the effectiveness of combinations of prevention strategies. They found that rather than look for a magic food or behavior that protects against cancer, we might be better off combining multiple prevention strategies. So far, a lot of the research into individual strategies for preventing cancer has produced mixed results. But where studies do show a positive effect, that effect is sometimes underwhelming, whether due to different study designs or other reasons. But the international team behind this week's study thought that the effects might be more significant if some of these strategies were combined. So they decided to carry out an experiment, with the help of 2100 participants in five different European countries, all of them cancer-free and over the age of 70. For this study, researchers combined three interventions that have had some effect on cancer cells, but have had mixed results in prevention studies. The first was vitamin D. Vitamin D slows the growth of cancer cells by messing with the genes that control cell reproduction and functionality. But in randomized clinical trials, vitamin D doesn't seem to do much to actually prevent most cancers. At most, it may help prevent advanced cancer and cancer deaths. The second intervention was a specific kind of omega-3 fatty acid. These nutrients, which can be found in things like fish oil and marine algae, have been shown to reduce inflammation, cell reproduction, and the development of new blood vessels that can feed tumors. But overall, randomized clinical trials show that Omega-3 supplements don't do much either when it comes to cancer prevention. The researcher's third intervention was even simpler \u2014 exercise. Exercise can decrease inflammation and increase immune system function, both of which could prevent cancer. And many studies have shown that exercise is at least associated with a decreased risk of cancer. But very few have been able to determine whether or not exercise actually causes that decreased risk. That's because not many have been randomized controlled trials like this one, which are the gold standard for investigating cause and effect. So the authors of this study wanted to explore the effect of these three interventions put together. To do that, they divided the participants into various groups. Some groups got just one of the interventions, others got a combination of two or three interventions, and another group got a a placebo. Participants who were assigned vitamin D and omega-3 supplements took those as pills once a day. The exercise intervention was designed as a simple at-home workout that could be done in the living room. The participants continued with the interventions they were assigned for the next three years. During that time, the researchers checked in every three months to see if any participants had developed an invasive cancer. That's a cancer that can't just be cut out of the tissue it developed in. And at the end of the three years, the researchers assessed the overall effect of the interventions on the different groups. They found that each of the three individual interventions showed a small, preventative benefit, but not enough that scientists could be sure that it wasn't just due to chance. On the other hand, in the group that got all three interventions, participants were 61% less likely to have developed an invasive cancer than the group that got the placebo. These results are exciting, particularly because all of the interventions are theoretically pretty easy. Vitamin D and omega-3 supplements are widely available, though the quality, purity, and dosage of supplements can vary enormously. And exercise is free, give or take whatever gym memberships you sign up for. The researchers also claim that this was the first randomized controlled trial of exercise as a potential method of cancer prevention ever. The results suggest that it may be helpful to think about cancer prevention as a combination of strategies that interact to lower your risk rather than a single strategy that works alone. But this regimen is not necessarily a silver bullet. While 2100 participants sounds like a lot once you split them into all the different groups, it's actually kind of a small study with a couple hundred people per group, which means that the number of cancer cases in general was pretty small. And it's harder to draw conclusions from small numbers. It's also too small a sample size to make any claims about whether this regimen is good or bad at preventing any specific kind of cancer. Finally, when it comes to thinking about cancer prevention three years, actually isn't very long. So scientists will need to replicate these results and extend similar studies over a longer period of time to get a better idea of just how meaningful these results are. But for now, they are promising. Because as of today, approximately 40% of people in the US will get cancer during their lifetime. While many of those cases can be successfully treated, cancer is still the second leading cause of death worldwide. And it costs the US alone around $150 billion a year. So any steps that we can take to prevent cancer are incredibly important. And this study gives us a new way to think about just how we might do that. Mr. Frosty sounds like a frozen summer treat, but it's also the name of a cancer-fighting gecko. And some people would say that that's even cooler. He got his name because of his white and yellow coloring, a special pattern known as lemon frost that is encoded in his genes. And these colors make geckos like him very sought after. But it turns out that his beautiful white pigment is produced by cancerous skin cells. So scientists studied Mr. Frosty and his family and got to the root of some questions about where skin cancer comes from, even in humans. Researchers at UCLA bought Mr. Frosty from a gecko breeder to figure out how these color-producing cells developed and evolved. And in the process, they were able to figure out some of the genes that regulate the cancer, making those colorful skin cells. First, they needed to know how many genes make lemon-frost colors. So the UCLA researchers bred Mr. Frosty with some wild-type geckos to see what their babies would look like. wild type is the term researchers use to describe a genetically typical animal. About half of the babies were lemon-frost geckos, suggesting that lemon-frost is the coloration of a gecko with half-wild-type genes and half-mutated genes. Then, those lemon-frost baby geckos grew up and were bred with each other. And the babies from two lemon-frost parents were about half lemon-frost, about a quarter had even more white pigment, known as super-lemon-frost, and about a quarter were wild-type. That spread basically means that lemon frost likely comes from just one mutation in a single segment of DNA. The researchers also figured out that Mr. Frosty's lemon frost mutation occurs on a gene that makes a ton of white skin cells when it's mutated. And that's the basic idea of some cancers. When cells aren't properly regulated, your body keeps making more and more of them until it becomes a problem. As you might imagine, geckos that have two copies of the mutation develop even more tumors. Unfortunately, that's also what makes them stand out with pretty colors on their skin. And here's the thing. You have that same gene that was mutated in Mr. Frosty's DNA. It's called spint1. Lots of animals have similar genetics, and it's not always because we're directly related. Sometimes we have a common ancestor, but other times, we both had similar genetic mutations that allowed us to develop similar physical features. It's called parallel evolution. And spint1 is a gene in humans, as well as in other animals, that determines if you'll develop tumors or not. It carries the genetic code for a protein called hi1, which stops growth factors. Those are the molecules that usually direct cells to either make more of themselves or not, but high 1 stops them from sending pro-growth signals. So if you have cancer cells that won't stop reproducing, high 1 is a part of the process that brings them back into check and signals them to reproduce less. Scientists think this is one way that Spint1 reduces cancer. Since high 1 is a product of Spint1's code, a mutation that changes Spint1's code, like what was found in Mr. Frosty's DNA, could allow cancer cells to develop. So, Spint1 is likely to be a big player in cancer development and regulation in humans and geckos. Now, not all geckos with its genetic mutation develop malignant skin tumors, but 80% did in the UCLA study, which are not good odds. See, if you have a mutation in the Spint1 gene, you don't automatically get cancer. Just like if you don't have it, you're not automatically cancer-free. One way these genes can become more or less influential is by how often they are allowed to do their jobs. Sometimes, genes can't produce what they're supposed to because there's something blocking them from making proteins. And if that happens, they end up having less of an impact. So when Spint1 can't make its high-1 protein to help regulate the production of cells, it can result in cancer. This is what happens to individuals with similar cancers to Mr. Frosty. Since the Spint1 and High1 that led to Mr. Frosty's cancer have also been found in humans, studying Mr. Frosty and his descendants could help us understand where some of our cancers come from and how to stop them from progressing. We're all pretty familiar with cold and flu season. But a few decades ago, public health experts began to notice that some non-infectious diseases like breast cancer followed a seasonal pattern, too. Which might seem strange, because we don't talk about a cancer season the way we talk about flu season. But these annual spikes can teach us a lot about how our bodies interact with the environment. Scientists explain the seasonality of infectious diseases like the flu by looking at a bunch of different factors. like how the host's behavior spread the disease, or how the biology of the virus changes over the course of the year. The influenza virus is transmitted most effectively in cool, dry weather. So even though you can get the flu whenever, fall and winter are its favorite time of year. But diseases that aren't caused by germs can see regular seasonal spikes for totally different reasons, like the influence of the sun. We've known for a long time that excessive exposure to sunlight increases someone's chances of developing skin cancer. That's because ultraviolet radiation from the sun damages DNA and interferes with its ability to repair itself. A fairly routine process that DNA does constantly. And more people are diagnosed with skin cancer in the summer months than in the winter. In the long term, we also see more skin cancer diagnoses along with the solar cycle, an 11-year fluctuation of solar activity. Simply enough, when the sun emits more UV, we see more skin cancer. The solar cycle doesn't affect your individual risk as much as, say, wearing sunscreen. But there's enough of an impact that we can see it in the overall population. While skin cancer has a pretty well-understood mechanism, the spike in coronary artery disease that doctors see every winter is not as straightforward. Our circulatory systems respond to drops in temperature by constricting our blood vessels. When that happens, the heart has to pump blood against more resistance, which increases blood pressure. and high blood pressure is an important risk factor in cardiovascular disease. And studies in rodents suggest that reduced temperature also impairs the body's ability to make nitric oxide, a chemical that expands blood vessels and reduces blood pressure. Certain hormones also fluctuate with temperature. For instance, thyroid hormone helps regulate how forcefully our hearts contract and expands blood vessels. And exposure to cold conditions decreases thyroid hormone levels. disease is caused by the interaction of so many different factors that it's hard to point to just one thing that makes the biggest difference. But these factors might give insight to a larger trend. Breast cancer is another disease that sees a seasonal spike in diagnoses in the spring and fall, and a patient's chances of survival are usually better if it's diagnosed in the summer than in the winter. And that puzzles scientists because breast cancer can be developing for years before it's detectable, so it shouldn't matter when you find it. Breast cancer can grow quickly, though, and something has to explain those clear seasonal peaks and valleys. So in the last few years, researchers have been looking for anything that might cause faster growth rates, and pushed more breast cancers to the point where they're more easily detectable on a mammogram. We know that some types of breast cancers can grow faster thanks to estrogen receptors on their cells. Those cells tend to grow faster in the presence of estrogen. Since estrogen sees annual peaks and valleys, the seasonality of the hormone might have explain the seasonality of the disease. But the same seasonal spikes in breast cancer diagnoses are seen in people with ovaries, which make estrogen, both pre-imposed menopause. Since the body makes much less estrogen during menopause, we'd expect to see some kind of difference if it could be explained by that hormone. So scientists have looked into other substances that fluctuate throughout the year, including vitamin D and melatonin. And here's where it gets a bit complicated. Our bodies create more vitamin D during the summer thanks to more sun exposure, and mammals to create melatonin at different times of the day in response to darkness. So some researchers think that the rise in vitamin D protects us during the summer, while melatonin protects us during the winter, thus explaining the spring and fall peaks in breast cancer. And in the last few decades, different studies have shown that treating breast cancer cells with a vitamin D derivative might prevent them from growing and encourage them to die outright. This tissue has an enzyme that converts a vitamin D precursor molecule into that supposedly beneficial derivative. And those cells can also have the ability to pick up vitamin D as well. A 2019 meta-analysis of 70 studies showed that low vitamin D levels in the blood were associated with increased risk of breast cancer. And it's the same story with melatonin. Early studies showed that melatonin slowed the growth of breast cancer cells in the lab, And studies since then have shown that it can modify estrogen receptors on certain types of breast cancers. But that's not the end of the story. There's some support for both of these mechanisms, but overall, the evidence is mixed. A meta-analysis from 2017 found no association between urinary melatonin levels and breast cancer risk. But previous meta-analysis found that less melatonin did increase breast cancer risk. Researchers have also conducted randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for investigating a causal relationship, and found vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the incidence of breast cancer. That means we're not really sure yet why breast cancer has that weird double seasonal peak. It'll take a lot more research to know for sure. In general, it's a combination of factors that predispose us to certain diseases, so teasing out causation from correlation can be tricky. Medical treatments have come a long way in the last couple centuries. We now have all sorts of options from carefully formulated capsules to treatments that harness x-rays. But for all our progress, modern medicine still has a ways to go, especially when it comes to cancer treatments. That's because cancer drugs often target any rapidly dividing cells, which include, but are not limited to, a patient's cancer. That can lead to some not-so-nice side effects, like nausea or hair loss. But researchers might have found a way to treat tumors and only tumors by exploiting their love for iron. And they published their findings this week in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. Researchers were interested in a particularly nasty kind of pancreatic cancer called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or PDA. Treatments for PDA aren't that effective right now, partly because tumors start out microscopic in size, making it hard to get the drugs to go there. So having a targeted treatment option would be really helpful. One way to target cancer cells may be to go after one or several of the mutations that make them different to the body's regular cells. And that's what researchers in this study were looking at, a mutation in the K-RAS protein. In healthy cells, this protein acts as an important on-off switch for cell growth, where it sends signals to the cell telling it to divide. Mutated K-RAS is stuck in the on position, meaning the cells grow out of control, which leads to cancer. But these researchers noticed something else about cells with K-RAS mutations. They loved iron. In particular, a relatively reactive form of iron called ferrous iron. Researchers noticed that genes that controlled iron intake and metabolism were really active in PDA tumors. And that meant that those tumors ended up with lots of iron stored up inside them. The tumors were so chock-full of iron that the researchers described these tumors as having an addiction to this stuff. Researchers thought they could use the tumor's addiction against them to deliver anti-cancer drugs directly into tumor cells. They started with a drug called an F-E-A-D-C, short for ferrous iron-activatable drug conjugate. This is a mouthful, but they do exactly what it says on the tin. They are inactive until they come in contact with ferrous iron, and then they switch on and release the drug. By linking one of these FADCs to an already-existing cancer drug called cobimetonib, researchers created a drug that was activated only inside human PDA tumor cells full of iron and not healthy skin or eye cells. See, healthy eyes, skin, and gut tissue are often the unassuming victims of these kinds of anti-cancer drugs, so researchers were particularly interested to see if this new drug avoided them. By adding the FEADC to the cancer drug, the drug was essentially switched off until it came in contact with ferrous iron in the tumor. They called the drug combo TRX-Coby. Next, researchers tested TRX-Coby on different mouse models that had different kinds of K-Rastriven cancers, including PDA, but also a kind of lung cancer. And again, the drug slowed down tumor growth without harming the mice's healthy cells compared to when they tried cobimitten upon its own, which affected regular and cancer cells. Plus, the drug did not go after organs that naturally have iron stored up in them, like the liver. That might be because the iron stored there is in an inactive form, so it can't activate the drug in the same way as the ferrous form. In short, this new drug worked as well as an existing cancer drug, but without all the toxicity. In the final test, researchers tried TRX-CoB together with other anti-cancer drugs. Because if the drug wasn't harming regular cells, then maybe patients could handle a more intense burst of therapy to really knock out their tumor. And these combination therapies worked even better at limiting tumor growth in those mouse models with few side effects on normal tissue. And the researchers think this iron switch could be used with other anti-cancer drugs, too. Of course, this study was done in the lab and in mice, so it's not up to human testing quite yet. With more work, it could lead to more effective cancer treatments with fewer side effects down the line. Cancer loves sugar. So much that it is willing to be sloppy in the way that it makes energy just so it can gobble up more of the stuff. Lucky for us, this flaw is exploitable. We can use a machine called a PET scanner to watch where sugar goes in the body, and that can lead us right to a patient's cancer. Better yet, as scientists learn more about why cancer cells have such a love affair with the sweet stuff, we might be able to develop new treatments, too. [\u266a INTRO Music playing<|ru|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|><|en|><|zh|> glucose, and it gets sucked up by sugar-hungry cells. And since cancer cells have the ultimate sweet tooth, they show up as bright blotches on a PET scan. As you may or may not know, the reason why I keep wearing hats and SciShow videos is that I'm currently undergoing cancer treatment. So I go in for my PET scan, and it's a little freaky, because they've got, like, the thing they're going to inject into your veins in, like, a lead-lined syringe to protect the tech. Because they're, of course, going to get exposed to tons of it working for years as radiation techs. But still, it's a little weird to have something that someone can't touch, get injected into your veins. And then I get the scan back, and it shows me exactly where the cancer is. And I'm like, yeah! Radiation in the cancer, that's great! Then I also see that my brain is going like crazy, because the other place that consumes a lot of glucose is up here. So that's roughly how it all goes down. But if you've had this experience, you might be wondering to yourself, like I did, why does cancer like sugar so much? And scientists would love to know that, too, because on the surface, this love affair doesn't make any sense. These cells produce and use energy mainly in the form of a molecule called ATP. Most of the time, healthy cells use oxygen to produce ATP from glucose through a series of biochemical reactions called respiration. Now, respiration actually happens in a series of steps, the first one being glycolysis, where glucose is turned into two of a smaller molecule called pyruvate and two molecules of something called NADH. It can then be broken down further to make energy in one of two ways. First, when there's enough oxygen around, pyruvate undergoes the complex process of oxidative phosphorylation, where the mitochondria convert it into energy. We're going to refer to that one just as respiration for convenience, to make things easier to follow. The alternative to respiration happens when there's not a lot of oxygen around. You still start with glycolysis, but after that, pyruvate takes an alternative route called fermentation, where it's broken down less completely for less energy. The respiration is great because cells can make a lot of energy through glycolysis, plus oxidative phosphorylation. Fermentation is okay, too, because cells can still get the energy they need, but it is less efficient. Cells only get around 6% of the energy per unit of glucose from fermentation compared to respiration. Cancer cells have, for some strange reason, switched most of their energy making to fermentation, even though there is plenty of oxygen around. They're still doing that first step glycolysis, and some of that pyruvate goes through the respiration pathway, but somewhere between 56 and 63% of the ATP cancer cells make comes from fermentation. Researchers also call this kind of fermentation aerobic glycolysis, to point out that this kind of energy making is happening with oxygen. And since fermentation is less efficient, cancer cells take up more and more sugar to get the energy they need. There's even a name for cancer's sugar obsession. It's known as the Warburg effect after the scientist who discovered it. And although it might seem totally odd, around 70-80% of human cancers get their energy this way. Warburg noted that it might be because the mitochondria, the parts of the cell that carry out respiration, become damaged in cancer cells. But it turns out the mitochondria are not only surviving, they are thriving. Plus, cancer cells aren't the only ones that use aerobic glycolysis. Some, but not all, healthy human cells that multiply rapidly do the same things. So researchers think there must be another reason. Now, one theory is speed. Aerobic glycolysis is between 10 and 100 times faster at making energy than respiration. Which makes up for the fact that the process is so inefficient, providing there's enough glucose to go around. But cells, including cancer cells, have all kinds of other ways of making energy speedily, so it's weird that most cancers would choose this one way. And dividing and growing new cells actually doesn't take that much energy, at least not so much that a cell would need to resort to desperate measures just to make energy quickly. Another explanation is that cells have other needs than just energy. They also need to make all the stuff that becomes all the parts of a new cell. A dividing cell needs to make more stuff. DNA, proteins, membranes, everything. Otherwise, you just get two new, half-sized cells. In 2021, researchers proposed a molecule that I have mentioned here, NADH, might actually play an important part. More specifically, it's counterpart, NAD+. The NAD-plus has many roles in the cell, including helping make all that stuff a new cell needs. But it's also involved in both halves of the energy-making pathway, respiration and fermentation. Remember how I said that after the first step of energy-making, glycolysis, you get a few molecules of NADH? NAD-plus and NADH cycle between their two forms by either gaining or losing electrons, and when they do, they help create energy. But at the end of both fermentation and respiration, NADH is turned back into NAD+. So the whole thing can start over again, and the cell can metabolize more glucose. But for cancer, say the researchers in that 2021 paper, there's a catch. In the process of respiration, the amounts of ATP and NAD+, you get at the end are linked. So if you want to make more of one, you also got to make more of the other. That means that if a cell needs more NAD+, relative to ATP, Say, if it needs to break down lots of glucose or make lots of stuff, then regular respiration actually isn't the best way to go. Instead, it makes more sense for the cell to use fermentation to get a little more NAD+, back at the end of it. Now, we did not need to understand the complex biochemistry behind cancer cells' sugar crush to exploit that fact for PET scans. But it might just help researchers develop better cancer treatments. Now, it's not as simple as just not eating sugar. Our bodies are really good at getting glucose into the bloodstream, because that's how all of the cells work. This is a bit of a myth of the alternative cancer treatment space, based on oversimplifying how all this complicated energy metabolism stuff works. So one idea is to suppress tumor growth by tapping into some of those metabolic pathways and limiting how much of that stuff cancer cells can make. Of course, like all things cancer, tumors are complex beasts, and there's never going to be a one-size-fits-all answer. But every time we find a one-size-fits-some solution, those people's lives get that much better. Mantis shrimp have lots of striking characteristics. They have big rainbow-colored bodies, and they punch so strong it can break glass. But one of their more discrete superpowers is the ability to see polarized light. This might not seem like a huge deal, except that cancer cells interact with polarized light in a unique way. So researchers are developing cameras that can see like mantis shrimp see and detect very early stages of cancer. Compared to humans, mantis shrimp have incredibly advanced eyesight that allows them to very accurately scan for prey or potential threats. To start, they have compound eyes, similar to those of a fly. Each eye is divided into three sections that the shrimp can move independently. And while humans have three different color receptors, mantis shrimp have sixteen. Plus, they have six receptors capable of picking up different kinds of polarized light. Now, most light sources we encounter, like the sun and light bulbs, emit unpolarized light. Unpolarized light is messy. It's made of multiple waves that vibrate in multiple directions, technically planes, at the same time. But there are a few different ways for light to become polarized, where light waves are vibrating only in one plane. Reflecting off surfaces, for example, or passing through something like polarized sunglasses. And mantis shrimp eyes can detect polarized light. People believe mantis shrimp evolved this ability for hunting. When light gets reflected off an animal, like a fish with shiny scales, some of it becomes polarized. So thanks to their unique eyesight, mantis shrimp can accurately spot their unsuspecting prey underwater. Mantis shrimp can even perceive circular polarized light, a hard to see light wave that rotates its plane of polarization in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Mantis shrimp use circular polarized light to communicate within their species. bodies have reflective surfaces capable of producing this kind of light, which they flash like a secret message. Now, human eyes can detect some polarized light, but not nearly to the same extent as mantis shrimp. And we can't distinguish circular polarized light at all. That's partly because mantis shrimp eyes have more receptors. Plus, all the shrimp's photosensitive bits are stacked on top of each other, and their polarization receptors are oriented in different directions. This makes it possible for the shrimp to intercept light waves coming from multiple directions at the same time, and helps them perceive changes in polarization. Researchers believe these shrimp can even rotate the different sections of their eyes to maximize their detection of polarized light. Similar to a person like Pudding on polarized sunglasses to filter a glare. Polarized sunglasses can block light waves vibrating in one direction, while allowing light waves vibrating in another direction to pass through. So where does cancer diagnosis fit into this already really remarkable story? Could we put a mantis shrimp on someone with cancer and have it punch them in the tumor? No. As cool as that would be. But in their 2017 paper in the journal Optica, researchers from the University of Illinois say they were inspired by the mantis shrimp's sophisticated eyesight to develop a camera capable of detecting cancer cells very early in their development. In particular, they drew inspiration from the shrimp's stacked photoreceptors. In their camera, the researchers stacked multiple silicon photodiodes on top of each other. They combined this with a carefully arranged pattern of metallic nanowires to act as polarization filters. This allows the camera to see in color and detect polarized light coming from different directions, much like the mantis shrimp. And that's key to identifying cancer in its early stages, because when researchers aim polarized light at tissues in the body, the light is scattered by the cells. And they've found that healthy cells all scatter this light in a similar way, but cancerous cells do not. That's partly because fast-growing cancer cells are oddly shaped and irregularly spaced in comparison to healthy tissue. They can also have multiple nuclei and be denser than a healthy cell. In 2013, researchers studying colorectal cancer proposed that cancer cells can even change the direction of circular polarized light. And the degree to which they change this light's direction depends on how aggressive that cancer is. This impact on polarized light shows up very early on, prior to the onset of symptoms or changes that are visible to the human eye. So a camera capable of viewing multiple types of polarized light would be an extremely useful tool for early cancer detection, especially during procedures that require a miniature camera like a colonoscopy, for example. During this type of procedure, a doctor uses a small camera to spot tissues that look different from healthy tissue. This means the cancer has to be fairly advanced for our feeble eyesight to notice a difference. But the shrimp-inspired camera could improve cancer detection rates during these procedures. In fact, early prototypes used on mice have successfully revealed where healthy tissue ended and cancerous tissue began. If doctors can use these cameras to find tumors much earlier on, they can use less invasive treatments and decreased recovery times. As an added bonus, this camera is smaller, lighter, and less expensive than existing technologies, which means it could be really useful in resource-limited locations. So one day, these cameras could become a part of your doctor's toolkit, bringing the superpower of a mantis shrimp's eye to your very colon. Not all cancer cells are created equal. Some have mutations in their genes that make them better at getting around treatments like chemo or radiotherapy. Which means a tumor can develop therapeutic resistance, where those treatments don't work as well anymore. And even just a few cells left over after a treatment can turn into another tumor. But new research might help scientists understand how cancer cells evolve their differences. And that could help them understand and combat therapeutic resistance, or develop even more targeted therapies in the future. In this study, published in the journal Nature in December, Researchers looked at acute myeloid leukemia, a type of blood cancer. They tracked cells in three slightly different mouse models of leukemia, where all the mice had been infected with genetically identical cancer cells. Researchers then used a technique called splinter. That stands for single-cell profiling in lineage tracing to track individual cells. That would let them see which specific cells were doing something different, and therefore could become the dominant cells that form new tumors. Cancer works by tagging the DNA of individual cells with sequences of other DNA called barcodes. Those barcodes let researchers see which bits of DNA are actually being used by the cancer cell. The barcodes are also inherited along with the cancer DNA, meaning the researchers can also track how the cell evolves by seeing which bits of DNA stick around. They found that even though all the cancer cells had the same genetics, they behaved differently in different mice. See, different cells can turn on different sets of genes, or use the same genes more or less compared to other cells, even if all those cells have the same DNA. And because turning different genes on means that the cell will make different proteins, cells that might look identical DNA-wise might actually behave quite differently. In this paper, the researchers were interested in understanding which genes were transcribed in leukemia stem cells. These are cells that are likely to become the dominant ones and end up forming a new tumor. Researchers saw that leukemia stem cells repressed genes that tell the cancer cell to decorate itself with molecules that the immune system recognizes. Those molecules match up with immune cells that keep cancer under control by killing potentially dangerous cells. Leukemia stem cells also expressed a gene for a particular tumor growth factor more. Basically, they were better at being cancer-y. This study is the first time researchers have been able to study how individual cancer cells with the same genes might behave differently. The hope now is that other scientists can use the splinter tool to study other types of cancer. Because this finding could be really important to the emerging field of personalized cancer treatments. There's a lot of interest in developing treatments tailored to the patient right now, but our ability to do so mostly relies on looking for genetic differences underlying their cancer or other disease. And what this study shows us is that researchers and doctors will have to consider not just a disease's genetic profile, but how those genes are used as well. The title of this video does not make sense. There are no single-celled dogs. Dogs aren't just multicellular. They're vertebrates, mammals even. A single-celled organism is by definition not a dog. And yet. And yet. Between 6 and 11,000 years ago, there was a dog. I do not know the dog's name. I don't even know if it was male or female. But we do know quite a bit about it. It was black or brown, with more than a bit of coyote ancestry, and it came from an inbred population. And also, we know it had cancer. And to understand what happened next and how truly bizarre it is, you have to understand what cancer actually is. And I know what you're saying, Hank, I know what cancer is. And maybe you think you do. You think that cancer is a disease caused by an organism's cells malfunctioning and reproducing uncontrollably, and moving to different parts of that organism's body. And that is true, but also, it's kind of not true. The question is, are the cells malfunctioning, or are they succeeding? And to answer that question, you have to ask another one. Why do malfunctioning cells so often reproduce uncontrollably? Now, it's convenient to talk about evolution in terms of what it wants. But evolution doesn't want anything. One school of thought proposes that natural selection is simply successful traits and their associated genes succeeding and being passed on to future generations. And nearly every cell in a dog is trying to help the dog survive. This is what evolution is selecting for at the scale of the dog. Cells work together to keep the animal functioning so that the genetic material can persist in the current dog, but more than that in the offspring of the dog. But sexual reproduction isn't the only kind of reproduction. Celled organisms often reproduce asexually, and natural selection, nonetheless, still results in evolution in those species, just more slowly. And we can imagine that inside of a dog, natural selection isn't just selecting on the scale of the dog. It's also selecting on the scale of the cell. Natural selection is not a complicated idea. If something can make more of itself, then there will be more of it. If a rat has a gene that allows it to have a thousand babies, then that gene will spread throughout the rat population pretty dang fast. But if a cell inside an organism has a gene that allows it to have 100,000 or 100 million copies of itself, that gene will also spread through the organism very, very rapidly unless something stops it. And when that happens, when individual cells inside an organism evolve ways to replicate themselves unchecked, we call that cancer. One way of thinking about cancer is that it is simply the result of evolution acting on the cells of a multicellular organism rather than the organism itself. And this is kind of a hot take, but it's one that makes sense according to what we know. Cancer cells are evolutionarily successful, not for the organism, of course, but for the cell. Seen through this lens, cancer is not an organism's cell's malfunctioning. It's kind of a return to a single-celled lifestyle. A step, at least. They still require you as a host organism. And since they usually hurt the host, you, in the process, it's not a great step. Still, your cells have become more like a pathogen. They have human DNA, but they have started living for themselves instead of for you, metabolizing, replicating, and evolving. So one way to look at cancer is that it is a single-celled organism with a multicellular organism's DNA. Now, evolutionary pressure on the organism level encourages lots of systems for preventing individual cells from growing unchecked, because when that happens, the organism can no longer pass on its genes because of how it is dead. But evolution at the level of the cell is hard to overcome. Natural selection is always selecting. Genes are always mutating. It only takes one cell being really good at evading the immune system, and selfishly replicating itself perpetually for the whole organism to crash. Great! Hank! Thanks! Wonderful! That's all very terrifying and upsetting. Cancer is the most natural thing ever, and despite the fact that our bodies have evolved a tremendous arsenal of tools to prevent it from killing us, it nonetheless remains an extremely common cause of death. But for the most part, aw, this is just semantic line-shifting. Is cancer a kind of single-celled organism? Is a hot dog a sandwich? It doesn't really matter. It's a deadly disease, and it's not like it's going to jump off of a sick person and go live on its own. Unless it does exactly that. Remember that dog that died thousands of years ago? Well, before it died, its cancer managed to spread to at least one other dog, potentially through sexual contact. These cancerous cells were now a contagious pathogen that, for thousands of years, have been successfully living the single-celled lifestyle. This disease is called canine transmissible venereal tumor, or CTVT. And you really cannot say that the cells that cause it aren't alive, because they grow, they reproduce, they metabolize, and they evolve. A dog with CTVT does not have a cancer made of its own cells. It has a disease made of cells that are descended from a dog that has been dead for thousands of years. As the authors of a 2014 paper put it, it is remarkable that a somatic genome whose DNA would normally have survived for no more than 15 years during the life of one dog has continued to exist for several millennia as a parasitic life form. CTVT's survival and global dominance is a testament to the ability of the mammalian somatic cell genome to adapt and persist in a new ecological niche. In other words, this cancer, if you look at it a certain way, is a single-celled dog. Now, the success of CTVT is very weird and unusual. Cancer cells evolve to succeed inside a very particular environment, the body they are part of. And they evolve to evade the immune system of that one organism. That's why cancer jumping from one organism to another is extremely rare. Now, we're not entirely sure how CTVT did this, but other transmissible cancers have occurred in species that were in population bottlenecks, which just means that their population shrank a lot, and the individuals in that group wound up being severely inbred. And it isn't difficult to imagine this happening to a population of early dogs. In a situation like this, CTVT would be able to jump from dog to dog because their low genetic diversity might have made it less likely that their immune systems would notice that those cells belonged to somebody else. Given the new evolutionary pressure not just to grow in one organism, but to be transmissible and survive in other organisms, CTVT continued to evolve, and it can now infect not just most dogs, but also related animals, like jackals and coyotes. The fact that there is a line of pathogenic cells reproducing asexually descended from an ancient dog that has persisted for millennia is one of the weirdest things that I have ever found out about biology. And it only makes sense to me if you view cancer not as a malfunction, but as a kind of terrible evolutionary success. Cancer, through this lens, is a kind of biological inevitability, And so we need to see it as a thing that our bodies have developed systems to control, and that we can help our bodies control. Evolution allows these selfish cells to evade both our bodies' systems for destroying them, and our technologies for destroying them. We are in a race, but it is one that we are winning more now than we ever have before.

I struggled with feelings of fear and worry over the years. When my doctor told me that the pain in my hands was caused by arthritis, those feelings continued to grow. I started to worry that I wouldn't be able to do the things I love, like gardening, playing the piano. I started having panic attacks and feeling like I couldn't breathe. I already had asthma, which can make breathing hard anyway. I was so stressed that I had trouble falling asleep at night. I found myself so tired during the day that I could barely focus on my work. It never occurred to me that mental health and physical health were so closely connected. I guess because you go to different kinds of health professionals for help. But I saw a news story that made me realize we really shouldn't think of them as two different kinds of health. We're joined today by Dr. Alan Welch, a medical doctor who says we should be thinking about our health much more broadly. Doctor, what kinds of things besides our physical health are important? Thank you for having me on today. And yes, that's correct. When we talk about someone who is healthy, we are talking about physical health, but also mental health, social well-being, and other resources a person needs to live a full life. That sounds like a lot more than just curing someone when they have a fever. You're right. Health isn't just the absence of disease. It also refers to a person's ability to bounce back from an illness or other challenges in life. There are many factors that contribute to our mental and physical health. Some factors include a person's genetics, their environment, their relationships, their education and their employment. These all impact a person's ability to lead a healthy life. So what can our viewers do to improve the kind of health you're talking about? Certainly eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercises directed by a physician are keys to good health. It is also important to have healthy coping skills when challenges come up in a job or a relationship. Having healthy social relationships can also contribute to a person's overall well-being, including their mental health. Hearing that doctor helped me understand that my stress was doing more than just impacting my physical health. It was also starting to hurt my relationships, affecting how I spent my free time and seemed to make me feel overwhelmed. In fact, learning that mental health is the way our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors affect our lives, helped me realize I needed to address my ongoing stress as a health issue, both physical and mental. I talked about this with my doctor, and he connected me with a therapist. I still meet with my therapist from time to time. In addition to the diet, exercise, and physical checkups from my doctor, my therapist has helped me learn to manage my stress, develop healthy relationships, and a more positive attitude. Each and every day is filled with unique ups and downs, but understanding the link between my physical and mental health has made a big difference in my ongoing recovery journey.", "transcript_length": 542, "reference_summary": "The narrative highlights the intertwined nature of mental and physical health through the author's personal experience with arthritis and anxiety. Initially, the diagnosis of arthritis triggered escalating fears about losing the ability to engage in beloved activities, leading to panic attacks and sleep disturbances.

It's true. Microorganisms called bacteria were some of the first life forms to appear on Earth. Though they consist of only a single cell, their total biomass is greater than that of all plants and animals combined. And they live virtually everywhere, on the ground, in the water, on your kitchen table, on your skin, even inside you. Don't reach for the panic button just yet. Although you have 10 times more bacterial cells inside you than your body has human cells, many of these bacteria are harmless or even beneficial, helping digestion and immunity. But there are a few bad apples that can cause harmful infections, from minor inconveniences to deadly epidemics. Fortunately, there are amazing medicines designed to fight bacterial infections. Synthesized from chemicals or occurring naturally in things like mold, these antibiotics kill or neutralize bacteria by interrupting cell wall synthesis or interfering with vital processes like protein synthesis, all while leaving human cells unharmed. The deployment of antibiotics over the course of the 20th century has rendered many previously dangerous diseases easily treatable. But today, more and more of our antibiotics are becoming less effective. Did something go wrong to make them stop working? The problem is not with the antibiotics, but the bacteria they were made to fight, and the reason lies in Darwin's theory of natural selection. Just like any other organisms, individual bacteria can undergo random mutations. Many of these mutations are harmful or useless, but every now and then, one comes along that gives its organism an edge in survival. And for a bacterium, a mutation making it resistant to a certain antibiotic gives quite the edge. As the non-resistant bacteria are killed off, which happens especially quickly in antibiotic-rich environments like hospitals, there is more room and resources for their resistant ones to thrive, passing along only the mutated genes that help them do so. Reproduction isn't the only way to do this. Some can release their DNA upon death to be picked up by other bacteria, while others use a method called conjugation, connecting through pylide to share their genes. Over time, the resistant genes proliferate, creating entire strains of resistant superbacteria. So how much time do we have before these superbugs take over? Well, in some bacteria, it's already happened. For instance, some strands of Staphylococcus aureus, which causes everything from skin infections to pneumonia and sepsis, have developed into MRSA, becoming resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin, methicillin, and oxicillin. Thanks to a gene that replaces the protein beta-lactam's normally target and bind to, MRSA can keep making its cell walls unimpeded. Other superbacteria like salmonella even sometimes produce enzymes like beta-lactamase that break down antibiotic attackers before they can do any damage. and E. coli, a diverse group of bacteria that contains strains that cause diarrhea and kidney failure, can prevent the function of antibiotics like quinolones by actively booting any invaders that manage to enter the cell. But there is good news. Scientists are working to stay one step ahead of the bacteria, and although development of new antibiotics has slowed in recent years, the World Health Organization has made it a priority to develop novel treatments. Other scientists are investigating alternate solutions such as phage therapy or using vaccines to prevent infections. Most importantly, curbing the excessive and unnecessary use of antibiotics, such as for minor infections that can resolve on their own, as well as changing medical practice to prevent hospital infections, can have a major impact by keeping more non-resistant bacteria alive as competition for resistant strains. In the war against superbacteria, de-escalation may sometimes work better than an evolutionary arms race.", "transcript_length": 623, "reference_summary": "Bacteria, some of the earliest life forms on Earth, outnumber human cells in our bodies by tenfold and are found in diverse environments. While many bacteria are beneficial, aiding in digestion and immunity, some can cause severe infections. Antibiotics, developed to combat these harmful bacteria, have revolutionized medicine by making once-deadly diseases treatable. However, the effectiveness of antibiotics is declining due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or \"superbugs.\" This resistance arises through random mutations that provide survival advantages, allowing resistant strains to thrive, especially in antibiotic-rich environments like hospitals. Notable examples include MRSA, which has developed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, and certain strains of E. coli that can actively expel antibiotics. Although the development of new antibiotics has slowed, scientists are prioritizing innovative treatments and exploring alternatives like phage therapy and vaccines. Additionally, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and improving hospital infection control can help maintain a balance between resistant and non-resistant bacteria. In the ongoing battle against superbugs, strategic de-escalation may prove more effective than an endless cycle of escalating antibiotic development.", "channel": "TED-Ed"}

A group of mold spores surf a breeze through a lab. They drift onto a petri dish and when they land, they germinate a medical revolution. This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist investigating the properties of infectious bacteria. At At this time, Fleming is away on vacation. When he returns, he finds a colony of mold growing on a petri dish he'd forgotten to place in his incubator. And around this colony of mold is a zone completely and unexpectedly clear of bacteria. In studying this mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold was secreting some kind of compound that was killing the bacteria. The mold was a species in the penicillium genus, so Fleming dubbed the antibacterial compound penicillin. What Fleming stumbled upon was a microbial defense system. The penicillium mold constantly produces penicillin in order to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies that might consume its resources. Penicillin destroys many types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis of their cell walls. These walls get their strength from a thick protective mesh of sugars and amino acids that are constantly being broken down and rebuilt. Penicillin binds to one of the compounds that weaves this mesh together and prevents the wall from being reconstructed at a critical phase. Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates the release of highly reactive molecules that cause additional damage. Eventually, the cell's structure breaks down completely. This two-pronged attack is lethal to a wide range of bacteria, whether in Petri dishes, or bodies, or elsewhere. It's not, however, harmful to our own cells, because those don't have cell walls. For a decade or so after Fleming's discovery, penicillin remained a laboratory curiosity. But during World War II, researchers figured out how to isolate the active compound and grow the mold in larger quantities. They then went on to win the Nobel Prize for their work. Teams at Oxford and several American drug companies continued development, and within a few years it was commercially available. Penicillin and similar compounds quickly transformed the treatment of infections. For the time being, they remained some of the most important life-saving antibiotics used in medicine. However, the more we use any antibiotic, the more bacteria evolve resistance to it. In the case of penicillin, some bacteria produce compounds that can break down the key structure that interferes with cell wall synthesis. As antibiotic use has increased, more and more bacteria have evolved this defense, making these antibiotics ineffective against a growing number of bacterial infections. This means it's essential that doctors not overprescribe the drug. Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of patients in developed countries self-identify as allergic to penicillin, making it the most commonly reported drug allergy. However, the vast majority, over 90% of people who think they're allergic to penicillin actually are not. Why the misperception? Many patients acquire the allergy label as children when a rash appears after they're treated for an infection with penicillin or closely related drugs. The rash is often blamed on penicillin, while the more likely culprit is the original infection or a reaction between the infection and the antibiotic. However, genuine penicillin allergies, where our immune systems mistake penicillin for an attacker, do occur rarely and can be very dangerous. So if you think you're allergic but don't know for sure, your best bet is to visit an allergist. They'll complete an evaluation that'll confirm whether or not you have the allergy. Even if you do have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug may lose their ability to recognize it. In fact, about 80% of people who are allergic to penicillin outgrow their allergy within 10 years. This is great news for people who currently identify as allergic to penicillin. The drug may one day save their lives, as it has done for so many others. How does medicine know where it needs to go?

Additionally, while 5 to 15% of people in developed countries report being allergic to penicillin, over 90% of these cases are misdiagnosed. Many mistakenly attribute rashes from infections to penicillin, rather than the infection itself.

If the last century belonged to physics and digital technology, many see the 21st century as the age of biology. With 3D printers and synthetic biology, guess what? The information revolution is coming to biology. A revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution with the speed of the digital revolution. And many are saying it is the biggest business and investment opportunity in all of history. If you really think about all the big 21st century problems like pandemic prevention, food technology, food security, ocean health, climate change, biology is going to play a role in all of them. Biotechnology companies in the West are harnessing the power of big data and artificial intelligence in order to develop new drugs and products. Pharmaceutical companies with patented cancer and heart disease drugs generate billions in revenue each year. But the US and Europe may not lead the field for much longer. China, as is the case in other technologies, is catching up fast. The distance between the US biotech company and the Chinese biocomedy and getting closer and closer. Over the last decade, the People's Republic of China has already made huge advancements in its biopharmaceutical industry. China now is the second largest farmer markets in the world, specifically the growth rate, significantly higher than other markets like the US. But its ambition to go from manufacturer to innovator is only just beginning. China is emerging as a formidable force for biotech innovation. And in the coming years, the balance of power and gene editing and synthetic biology may dramatically shift. It feels a lot like 1994 and there's this thing called the internet and that's where we are in synthetic biology. It's just before this part of our economy is going to launch and change everything. While Silicon Valley was the greatest benefactor of the internet age, China is making massive investments to be the home of the bio revolution in 2030 and beyond. China is home to one of history's oldest medical systems, with traditional Chinese medicines such as herbal treatments and acupuncture dating back more than 2,000 years. Now, China wants to dominate the biopharmaceutical industry of tomorrow. When I started the first company 19 years ago, at that time, most of the Chinese pharmaceutical company doing the generic drug. I would say more than 90, 95% of medicine in China was generic products. Production, manufacture, and almost no innovation drug research. You know, in the drug industry, there's kind of a rough divide between the companies that really deliver the innovations and then patent these drugs and have exclusive rights to sell them and then other drug developers that you know copy unpatented drugs and sell them around the world and at the start of the century that was kind of where China was. For the me too are fast follow drugs you don't have to do a lot of the research you already know but for first-in-class you don't know you don't know you know nothing about that. Well, when you have a breakthrough drug that is patented, obviously you're going to make more money on it. But it also can have kind of a cascading effect where if you develop a new area of research, you can kind of build on that and then one have one kind of breakthrough drug after another. This was the case in the US and Europe for companies like Merck, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. For example, Merck's immunotherapy cancer drug, called Ketruder, delivered more than $17 billion in revenue in 2021, making it one of the most profitable drugs in history. But the research needed to develop these first-in-class drugs takes time and large capital investments, which in China in the early 2000s was difficult to acquire. You know, that time the real estate was booming. People make lots of investments in areas that are easier to have a good return instead of in biotech or biopharma. Michael Yu is the CEO of Inevent, one of the earliest biotech companies to emerge from China. for the investment in biotech or biopharma because of the risk for the investor to take is too high and the return take too long to get a generated return. And the plus biotech, the capital market was not open for any company who has no profit. While a less risky business venture, focusing on creating generic drugs meant China was also losing some geopolitical power by relying on the drug industries of the US and Europe. China's 1.4 billion population is aging and the country faces high smoking rates and serious air pollution woes, creating big public health challenges for Beijing. Biotechnology is one of the seven strategic emergent industries that the Chinese government earmarked in its current five-year plan. In the mid-2010s, you saw a concerted effort by Beijing to improve China's competitiveness in all manner of strategic industries. Drug development was obviously one, AI was another one. At the same time, you saw a big push into renewable energy and electric vehicles. And today, China is now the biggest EV market in the world. In order to achieve the same success in the biopharma industry, China first focused on bringing its regulatory standards more in line with global benchmarks. Basically told its pharma companies that they had to match what the West was putting out. At the same time, they streamlined the Chinese drug approval process to give companies more of an incentive to get their drugs out into the market. combined these things both improve the quality but also the speed of Chinese drug development. So that moment I would say that changed everything. For R&D application used to be they take one to two years. I remember one of my applications took about 19 months but now it's two months. In 2017, China would also join the ICH, an international group of the world's regulators designed to harmonize drug development around the world. What I mean is that we follow ICH guidelines and regulations so that the drug we develop is in compliance with global standards, leading to a second change, which is the capital market. Starting in 2018, companies like Inevent were able to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and later the Shanghai Stock Exchange Star Market. And since then, money has flowed to these biotech companies. According to a McKinsey report from October 2021, the market value of publicly listed biopharma innovation players from China across major stock exchanges has surged from $3 billion in 2016 to more than $380 billion in July 2021. There is a tremendous amount of investor money both within China and around the world coming into the Chinese biotech system because China is the second largest healthcare market in the world. Its population is $1.4 billion. And as that population ages, one of the biggest risks is cancer. China accounted for an astounding 30% of cancer deaths globally in 2020. Since those 2015 reforms, though, more Chinese companies have been able to provide increased competition in the form of lower prices, in some cases, being able to sell products at a third of the price of US competitors. In the past five years, more companies, biotech companies in China, are starting to do the first in class. Dr. Wang is the CEO of Jaco Bio Pharmaceuticals. He views their research as not simply providing more competition, but part of a global pipeline for new drug development. We tried to do the in-house research. We set up the lab in Beijing, Boston, and that way we can have the more opportunity to collaborate with the global big farmers. One of these collaborations is a partnership between Jaco Bio and US-based ABV to help fund their research into SHP2 inhibitors. While the financials of the deal weren't made public, Jaco Bio will receive funding for its research, while ABV will provide its expertise in global development and eventual sale. Additionally, Jaco Bio has the ability to learn and grow, so that potentially it can become more than just a research group. So far, we are kind of clinical stage, pharmaceutical company, but we are building up our own manufacturing facility. And even in the future, we are thinking about build up our own marketing and sales team. Inevent has also had a strategic partnership with Eli Lilly and has seen significant growth. There's a dramatic change in last 10 years. We have a six product on market and it will generate multiple billing IMB in revenue. and we have the manufacturing capacity, the largest scale, and we have over 6,000 people now in our organisation. While growing quickly, bio-research in China is still behind the West. Most publicly, this has been seen in the area of vaccine research for COVID-19. China successfully administered 3.2 billion doses of its own vaccines, fully vaccinating around 87% of its population. However, these use an older method that has proven far less efficient than the mRNA-based vaccines developed in the US and Germany. With the Omicron subvariant of the coronavirus now spreading quickly across China, Beijing is again enacting strict lockdown measures. But as China is still growing its biotech industry, biotechnology itself is in the midst of a massive evolution. Biotechnology is really the marriage of biology and technology and more specifically it's this confluence of various disciplines over the last several decades where IT, artificial intelligence, software engineering, automation are kind of colliding with the the world of biology to design biological systems that improve our lives. One of the biggest areas has been the addition of AI computing to the drug industry. AI and an application of AI technology going to help drug discovery and drug development. And a very good example is the technology developed by Google. Developed by a group at Google's DeepMind, AlphaFold was an incredibly sophisticated AI computing system that was able to dramatically reduce the time it would take to predict the shape of a protein. It used to be, you know, take months or years to resolve a structure for a protein, you know, based on the old traditional technology. But now the technology development by Google, You can do that in hours or days. A team at MIT was also able to use AI to screen 100 million chemical compounds in just a few days and were able to identify a powerful new antibiotic. With our increasing ability to process biological data, a relatively new discipline has emerged called synthetic biology. So synthetic biology or bioengineering is really amazing. Essentially, it's become cheaper and faster and easier to digitize biology. Inside of every cell, every bacteria, plant, animal, and planet Earth is digital code in the form of DNA. So it's ATCs and Gs, but you can read that code with DNA sequencing, and importantly you can write that code. Jason Kelly is the CEO of US-based Ginkgo Bioworks, which works with companies to design cells and microbes for new drugs and consumer products. Synthetic biologists increasingly view cells as biological computers with software programs encoded in DNA. If you can debug that code, you can possibly cure diseases and make better products. For a bio nerd like me, this is magic. You literally go on a computer, you type ATC, you hit print, and out of machines like in this facility or the ones next door, comes a piece of DNA. That's exactly what you ordered. Using this technology, researchers were able to resurrect the scent of an extinct Hawaiian flower by extracting the DNA that encoded for the smell and placing it into a bacteria that it could then grow. But it's also allowing drug makers to automate more and more of drug discovery. The development of this field is fascinating. You know, you're enabling people to do a lot of things which they cannot do before. For example, you can see you may potentially synthesize more compounds for you to screen. That potentially increases the success rate of drug discovery. The applications of synthetic biology go way beyond just drug development. Think about meat being substituted with plant products. about biomaterials that can be used in manufacturing and even in the construction of our homes. The promise of synthetic biology is that we can use our knowledge of biology to engineer better versions of organic materials like animal meat or even wood, or replace non-biological items like plastic or airline fuel. The possibility exists too to create a biological solution to climate change. In a 2020 report, McKinsey estimated that 60% of the world's physical inputs could be made through biological means. And that in 2040 to 2050, the direct economic potential would be between $3 and $5 trillion. Just like we didn't know what uses the internet would have in 1994, there are so many potential positive uses of synthetic biology today that were just starting to scratch the surface. A lot of people talked about Moore's law kind of being a game changer in IT and that was a reference to the power of a computer chip increasing exponentially but also the cost tumbling down. If you look what's going on in the tools that are used to design biological systems, it's actually even more dramatic than with Moore's law. But the speed at which this technology has been democratized worries some in the international community. Synthetic biology is 99.9 percent promise. It's amazing how positive the impact will be on our lives. But there's that 0.0001% opportunity to misuse biology. One of the biggest factors in synthetic biology is how easy it's becoming to use the technology and access information. There was a group of scientists in Alberta, Canada, who in 2018, over a period of about six months and $100,000, they were able to recreate an extinct virus that causes horse pox. In doing so, they showed that we can recreate smallpox, or the variole virus that causes smallpox. But that information, that blueprint for these most dangerous viruses, most of it is in the public domain, and that gives information that could be seriously misused. Making things worse, the rate of technological development means the cost of such experiments are dropping dramatically. And where four years ago it may have taken a team of highly trained scientists a hundred thousand dollars and months to produce a virus, we're rapidly approaching a world where a single actor from anywhere could find the information of a deadly virus online. Take that code and reproduce it using affordable genetic sequencing tools and a portable DNA printer that fits on a desktop. Look how many people have been killed just during this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is 1% lethal. Some viruses are 30 or 50 or 60% lethal. So that means 60% of the people who are infected will die. Synthetic biology, of course, is a dual-use technology. It can be used as a force for good, but also can be quite threatening. And once you let the genie out of the bottle, it's very difficult to put it back in. We've already seen a very dramatic episode of that when back in 2018, a Chinese scientist used CRISPR editing technology, gene editing, on human embryos. Two beautiful little Chinese girls named Lulu and Lana came crying into the world as healthy as any other babies a few weeks ago. Heo Chiang Kui stunned the scientific community with the claim he pushed the boundary no one else had. Heo says he genetically edited human embryos, not just for research but for implantation, leading to the world's first births of genetically altered humans, baby girls born in China from embryos designed to be resistant to HIV. For this specific case, I feel... I feel proud, actually. He claimed that can prevent the baby from being infected by HIV. So that's technology-wise, I think that's viable. But as a kid, that's not allowed. So the scientific community needed regulations. Particularly those novel, novel technologies, you need a regulation in place. Otherwise, some crazy people will do something you don't want to see. The incident created international condemnation, and China would sentence the doctor and his staff to prison sentences for violating Chinese medical law. But as it stands, there is no effective international oversight for biotech. The world's biosecurity treaties and policies were designed in a Cold War era of state-directed bioweapons programs, not small groups or even single actors. In the West, some biohackers are not only selling CRISPR kits for less than $200, but have live-streamed injecting themselves with experimental therapies. This will modify my muscle genes to give me bigger muscles. Oh! I don't know, I don't know why people don't try it. I'll let you know how it works out. Ethical questions exist in the military as well. In December of 2020, John Ratcliffe, Donald Trump's intelligence chief, and a former Republican congressman from Texas, China had conducted testing on members of its military in an effort to develop biologically enhanced soldiers. Ratcliffe, however, didn't provide any evidence of his claims, which China labelled a miscellany of lies. AI2 poses a potential dual use threat. A team of researchers recently demonstrated how easy it was to repurpose AI used to help discover new drugs to instead discover potential new chemical weapons. In just six hours, the AI had identified 40,000 potential new toxins. But for those invested in this field, they believe the bio-revolution can happen without the apocalyptic outcomes. Well, when we were creating the internet, we weren't thinking about cybersecurity. It's actually a relatively new field. So now that we're in the early, the infancy stages of synthetic biology, we need to think about biosecurity and bake that in right from the get-go. Experts point to measures like removing public access to sensitive data on some of the worst pathogens, creating safeguards around what DNA suppliers are allowed to provide, and designing defences into DNA synthesizers themselves to recognise dangerous biomaterial before it's produced. But to build these successfully, the US, China and other countries will need to come together to make sure these preventative measures are put in place. Not an easy task by any means, especially with geopolitical tensions escalating higher than at any point since the Cold War. But if we're going to be able to reap the benefits of this biological revolution, measures will need to be put in place to maintain confidence in the technology. Confidence and gain confidence from the public population very critical. without those confidence, actually in a way that you heard harm the whole industry. A good example is the Nuclear Security Summit that President Obama led and well over 50 countries participated in those. And we made a lot of progress, even with countries like Russia and China. It's perhaps a little harder in this age of division and polarization, But we need to keep at it because essentially these are global issues and no single country can deal with them. The coming bio-revolution brings with it great promise and peril for humanity. Unraveling the secrets of cells and microorganisms could extend our lifespans and set the stage for a more sustainable global economy. Yet like all transformative technologies in history, there's a geopolitical dimension as well. China's economic ascendancy and competition with the West mean leadership in biological innovation will be contested. Just how this all plays out will be one of the more remarkable political and economic stories in the decades ahead.", "transcript_length": 3260, "reference_summary": "The 21st century is poised to witness a biorevolution, paralleling the transformative impacts of the industrial and digital revolutions. This shift is driven by advancements in synthetic biology and 3D printing, heralding a new era where biology becomes central to addressing critical global challenges such as pandemic prevention, food security, and climate change. Biotechnology firms, particularly in the West, are leveraging big data and AI to innovate in drug development, generating substantial revenues from patented medications. However, China's rapid progress in the biopharmaceutical sector is reshaping the landscape. Once predominantly focused on generic drugs, China is now striving to transition from a manufacturing hub to a leader in biotechnological innovation, with ambitions to dominate the industry by 2030. The country\u2019s historical roots in traditional medicine provide a unique foundation for this evolution. As China invests heavily in biotech, the balance of power in gene editing and synthetic biology is likely to shift, reminiscent of the early internet days in the 1990s. With significant advancements already made, China's emergence as a formidable player in the global biotech arena could redefine the industry's future.", "channel": "Bloomberg Originals"}
