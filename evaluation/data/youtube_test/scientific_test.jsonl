{"video_id": "ZihywtixUYo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZihywtixUYo", "title": "The Map of Physics", "domain": "scientific", "duration": 500, "transcript": "So physics is a huge subject that covers many different topics going from galaxies in the depth of space right down to subatomic particles and if you don't already know physics it's difficult sometimes to see how all of these different subjects are related to each other. So this is my attempt to show that in a map so this is the map of physics. I hope you enjoy it. Physics can be broadly broken down into three main parts. Classical physics, quantum physics and relativity. We'll start with classical physics and a good person to start with is Isaac Newton. His laws of motion describe how everything made of matter moves about and his law of universal gravitation tied together the motion of planets in the sky with the falling of objects on Earth into one elegant and general description. He also invented calculus, a supremely powerful mathematical tool which has been used over the centuries to drive new physics. Calculus is really a part of mathematics but physics and mathematics are inseparable. Maths is the language of physics and you can imagine it like the bedrock that the world of physics is built from. Newton also made strides in the field of optics which is the physics of light and how it travels through different materials. It explains refraction seen in prisms and and lenses which are used to focus light in telescopes, microscopes and cameras. Telescopes enabled us to peer into the depths of space and observe the world array of objects there and develop astrophysics and cosmology. Optics is closely related to the theory of waves, which is basically how energy can travel through disturbances of a medium, like ripples on the surface of a pond or sound through the air. Lights doesn't need a medium to travel through. It can travel through the vacuum of space, but it still follows the same principles as all waves, namely reflection, refraction and diffraction. This leads us to electromagnetism, the description of magnets, electricity, or more generally, electric and magnetic fields. It was a physicist called James Clark Maxwell who discovered that these are two aspects of the same thing and derived the wonderfully elegant rules of electromagnetism and theorised that light was an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetism also explains all of electricity. Jumping back a little bit, classical mechanics is related to Newton's laws and covers the properties and motion of solid objects, how they move when forces hit them, and what happens when they are joined together like in gears or in buildings or bridges. Fluid mechanics is the description of flows of liquids and gases. Using fluid mechanics you can work out how much lift is generated from the aeroplanes wing or how aerodynamic a car is. Fluid mechanics is notoriously difficult, mostly because the motions of tiny things like molecules get really complicated really fast, which leads us to chaos theory. Chaos theory is the description of large complex systems and how small differences in initial conditions can lead to very different final outcomes. Thermodynamics is the description of energy and how it passes from one form to another. It also includes entropy, which is a measure of order and disorder, and basically tells you how useful different kinds of energy are. Energy is a fundamental property to physics, and although I've written energy here, I should have written it everywhere on this map, because everything has energy. So that's all of classical physics, the picture of the universe we had around the year 1900. It told us we lived in a universe where everything ran sort of like clockwork. If you could measure everything accurately enough, the future was kind of predetermined. However, not everything was solved. There were just a few holes in experiments that hinted at something more. The orbit of Mercury was slightly too fast, and some strange things happened on the smallest scales with electrons and light, which were all unexplained. Physicists at the time thought that they'd solve and explain these problems soon enough, but poking at them they unravel the new domains of relativity and quantum physics and turned our understanding of the universe completely on its head. Albert Einstein was the genius who developed the theories of special and general relativity. Special relativity predicts that the speed of light is constant for all observers, which means that when you travel really fast weird stuff starts happening like time slowing down. It also states that energy and matter are different aspects of the same thing through the famous formula E equals mc squared. General relativity says that space and time are part of the same fabric called spacetime, and that the force of gravity comes from objects bending spacetime, making other objects fall in towards them. While relativity describes the very big, other physicists were busy at work on the very small in the world of quantum physics. Atomic theory probed the nature of the atom, and more and more detailed descriptions of the atom were developed, from a tiny sphere, to electron orbits, to energy levels, and then to the electrons being wave-like charge distributions. Pindense matter physics describes the quantum physics of many atoms together in solids and liquids, and is where many great technologies have come from, like computers, lasers, and quantum information science. Nuclear physics describes how the nucleus of atoms behave and explains radiation, nuclear fission, the splitting of an atom used in our nuclear power plant, and nuclear fusion, which takes place in the sun and will hopefully soon be harnessed here on Earth. Particle physics probes even deeper to find the fundamental subatomic particles that everything is made of, and are described in the standard model of particle physics. The quantum field theory captures all of quantum physics and combines it with a special theory of relativity, and it's the best description of the universe we have. Unfortunately, quantum field theory doesn't include gravity, and so physicists don't know how to join together quantum physics and the general theory of relativity, leading to the giant chasm of ignorance. One day in the future we hope to close this chasm and come up with a theory of all of physics. We call it quantum gravity. And there are many attempts to do this. Some examples of string theory or loop quantum gravity, and there's many more. But quantum gravity isn't the only thing we observe but don't understand. There are also the major puzzles of dark energy and dark matter, which seem to make up 95% of the universe. So all of our physics only really describes 5% of what we know about. And everything else at the moment is a mystery. And there are many other mysteries out there like the Big Bang and no doubt there's things beyond that that we don't even know that we don't know. Which gets to the lofty cloud which floats over all of physics, philosophy. Although many physicists make fun of philosophy, it's the big philosophical questions that motivate a lot of physics, like what is the fundamental nature of reality? How come the universe even exists? Do we have free will if we're just made of physics? Well how do we know that the way we do physics and science actually gets to the fundamental truth of the universe? And just why is all of physics like the way it is? Well those are rather big questions, ones which we may or may never answer, but there's no reason to give up trying. After all, physicists are not quitters. And that was the map of physics. So that's the end. Thanks for watching the video. I hope you enjoyed it. I'm still kind of working on the format of this channel, playing around with a few different things, and I kind of like this animation style. So let me know in the comments, if you enjoy this kind of stuff, you want me to do more. And if there's any specific subjects you want me to cover, I'm totally open to ideas.

Up, down, left, right, forward, back, and past and future. Three plus one dimensions. Or so our primitive, Pleistocene-evolved brains find it useful to believe. And we cling to this intuition even as physics shows us that this view of reality may be only a very narrow perception. One of the most startling possibilities is that our three plus one dimensional universe may be better described as resulting from a space-time one-dimension lower, like a hologram projected from a surface infinitely far away. The holographic principle emerged from many subtle clues, clues discovered over decades of theoretical exploration of the universe. Over the past several months on space-time, we've seen those clues. We've built the foundations needed to glimpse the true meaning of the holographic principle. We've moved from quantum field theory to black hole thermodynamics to string theory. We've made a background playlist if you want to start from scratch, and I especially recommend catching last week's episode. But this is tough material, so let's do a review. The story started with black holes, and with Jacob Bekenstein, who derived an equation to describe Their entropy. A black hole's entropy represents the amount of quantum information of everything that ever fell into it. This Beckenstein bound represents the maximum possible entropy slash information of any volume of space. Oddly, that maximum is proportional to the surface area of that space, not its volume. And that was surprising. Surely the information in a volume of space depends on that volume, like one bit per infinitesimal voxel, not one bit per pixel on the surface. Stephen Hawking confirmed the Beckenstein bound by calculating the amount of information leaked by a black hole as it evaporates in Hawking radiation. His discovery of Hawking radiation led to the black hole information paradox because this radiation was expected to erase the quantum information of everything that fell into the black hole. But destroying quantum information would break the foundations of quantum mechanics, hence the paradox. This conundrum inspired Gerard et Wouft to show that the information of all material that fell into the black hole could be imprinted on that outgoing Hawking radiation. And while it's waiting to be radiated, that information should be encoded on the event horizon of the black hole. Nice solution, but new paradox. Things that fall into a black hole do actually experience crossing the event horizon and being inside the black hole. So the interior of the black hole has a dual existence. From the point of view of outside observers, its contents are smeared into 2D on that surface. But from the POV of anyone falling in, they are definitely inside the black hole, plummeting to their doom in full 3D glory. This is the first glimpse of a holographic space time, a 2D surface that encodes the properties of the 3D interior. Atuft, along with Leonard Susskind, extrapolated this to propose that not only is any surface sufficient to describe the locations of all particles in its volume, but also the full machinery of that volume can exist on the surface. All degrees of freedom needed to describe the behavior of everything within. But it's one thing for this stuff to fit on the surface. But how is it actually encoded? How does the 2D surface store information about that extra dimension? And how do interactions on that surface correspond to interactions in the volume? Leonard Susskind laid out the first steps to how this could be achieved using string theory. But ultimately, it was one meldicenna who figured out a concrete string theoretic realization of the holographic principle with ADS-CFT correspondence. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's ignore string theory for the moment and just think about how to create an extra dimension. Let's say we start with a plane, a flat 2D spacetime. Now, grid it up into a lattice of cells and make a set of rules about how those cells interact with each other. Those rules are a field theory. The lattice itself is the field, and the cells are some elementary component of the field. But perhaps they're not the smallest possible component. For now, let's just say the size of those cells depend on how we're looking at the grid. For example, the resolution of our microscope or the power of our particle accelerator. Probably the rules between cells, the field theory, depends on their scale. Focus on a very small scale, and we see a very fine grid that interacts according to one set of rules. Zoom out, and we see a coarser grid with cells that are the average of smaller cells, but which presumably interact via different rules. Or so you'd think. But we're going to add something weird. We're going to say that our field theory is scale invariant. We'll say that the rules are the same for small pixels or big pixels. We see this scale invariance in fractal patterns, where the rules defining structures repeat to infinitely large or small scales. We also see it in string theory, which I'll come back to. A field theory with this property is called a conformal field theory. In the last episode, I said that a conformal transformation is one that leaves all the internal angles unchanged. A conformal field theory has this property. For example, you can change the scale at every point on the grid separately and not change the internal angles or the shapes of the pixels, which corresponds to not changing the rules of interaction. By making this conformal field theory, we've added a symmetry, invariance, under local changes in scale, also known as vial invariance. This adds a degree of freedom everywhere, like a new infinite number line at each of the 2D grid points. Objects on the 2D grid also have values on that number line. They exist at a certain scale. If objects at different scales don't tend to interact with each other, then this new degree of freedom behaves like just any other dimension. Now, 2D grid behaves like a 3D volume, and we can treat it like one, at least mathematically. You might say it's not a real 3D grid because the third dimension is fake. But is it? What is a dimension but a number line of possible values which, A, exists alongside the other dimensions but is independent of them? B, over which the rules of physics stay the same? And C, imposes some kind of locality. For example, elements of that number line need to be next to each other to interact. Crudely, this is how an extra dimension can be coded in a holographic universe. But for the details, we need string theory. Even from the beginning, string theory had hints of this scale invariance and dimensional weirdness. The first iteration of the theory around 1970 Try to model the strong force between pairs of quarks, mesons, and this strand of gluons that behaves like a vibrating string. A nice feature of this model is that changing the length of the strand, which defines the energy and the bond, doesn't change the basic physics. That means you can pretend string length slash energy is a separate dimension as a calculation trick. The weird thing is that when you write the quantum wave equation for the gluon strand with length expressed as a separate dimension, you get the wave equation of a graviton, the quantum particle of gravity, which is ridiculous given the puny energy scale of the meson. Gravitons shouldn't even exist there. This and other glitches led to string theory being abandoned as a model for the strong force, but it was quickly rejigged to make it a theory of quantum gravity. and the scale invariance of the strings became a central feature of string theory. Fast forward a couple of decades to the 90s, we now have several versions of string theory that try to explain how vibrating strings can lead to the familiar particles of the universe. These were tentatively united by Ed Whitten's M theory, which showed that different types of string and string theories were all related by dualities. A duality is when two seemingly different theories proved to represent the same underlying physical reality. These arose from the way string size and energy scales could be rescaled. But the strangest string duality was still to come with ADS-CFT correspondence, proposed by Argentinian physicist Juan Maldesena in 1997. Strange because it provided the first concrete description of a holographic universe. Meldesena imagined a set of string theory objects called brains. These are like multi-dimensional strings. The conservers start and end points for strings, but also as spaces embedded within higher dimensions. Meldesena considered geometrically flat 3D brains. These brains are extremely close together, basically overlapping. The strings connected to these brains are scale invariant. So their length and energy can vary without changing the physics. Under certain assumptions, he found that the resulting Brainy structure looked just like a Minkowski spacetime of 3 plus 1 dimensions on which there lived a field theory that arose from interactions between brains. In itself, that field theory wasn't stringy. Rather, it was a quantum field theory like the ones that give us our standard model of particle physics, a Young Mills theory, but with supersymmetry added in. It was also a conformal field theory, a CFT, so it was invariant to the scaling of grid sizes. This quality came from the energy scale invariance of the strings embedded in the construction of this space. In good old string theorist style, Maldicenna defined a new spatial dimension that incorporated that invariant scale factor. The 3D space became a 4D space. Well, the original space was flat. The new space had negative curvature. It was a hyperbolic anti-decider or ADS space. The conformal field theory in the original space included no gravity. But in the higher dimensional space, gravity emerged, revealing a full quantum theory of gravity. This is the ADS-CFT duality. As with the other dualities in string theory, this one was extremely useful for calculations. When interactions in the lower dimensional field theory are extremely strong, we would say the fields are strongly coupled, then the corresponding high dimensional gravitational structures would be weak and solvable. Conversely, strong gravitational fields in the high dimensional space, like in black holes, look like solvable configurations of particles in the lone d space. Among other things, this provided a new resolution to the black hole information paradox. The information lost in a black hole persists perfectly comfortably in the lower dimensional space. And the techniques of ADS-CFT correspondence are even extended to disparate fields like nuclear and condensed matter physics. But the more startling implication of ADS-CFT is that it's the first concrete realization of the holographic principle. The lower dimensional CFT space is the surface of the ADS space Because the field theory exists where that new dimension becomes infinite, infinitely far away. That's tough to imagine. So let's go back to our depiction of an infinite hyperbolic space from the last episode. Represent a 2D hyperbolic plane as a compactified map, and it has an edge, at least a mathematical one. Anyone inside the hyperbolic space still has to travel infinitely far to get to that edge. Now, stack many maps to represent slices in time. The resulting column has a geometrical flat and finite surface that is a spacetime all on its own. The rules of interactions between cells on that surface is a quantum field theory, but those rules translate to interactions in the volume, in the bulk, where it's a theory of gravity. ADS-CFT is a hint that we may live in a holographic universe. Now, ADS-CFT doesn't represent this universe because our universe doesn't appear to be negatively curved ADS space, nor does it have four spatial dimensions as in Melders Center's calculation. But there are efforts to generalize this to a universe more like our own. The question we now wrestle with is this. A series of mathematical clues indicate that our universe may be holographic, or at least have a dual representation in a lower dimension. Can these just be crazy mathematical coincidences? Maybe. But perhaps our familiar 3 plus 1 universe has an alternative, perhaps a more true representation out there, an abstract mathematical surface infinitely far from our location and from our intuition, projecting inwards our familiar holographic spacetime. Before we jump into comments, I want to let everyone know that there's new merch in the merch store, including the return of our Game of Thrones inspired shirt that the heat death of the universe is coming. It's a great way to support us as is joining us on Patreon. Links in the description. So last week was the warm up to today's episode, in which we looked at how infinite spacetime can have a finite boundary. And first up, no psychedelics were involved in making that episode despite what people thought. The universe is just that weird. A few of you asked whether our perceived universe is just the surface of a higher dimensional space. So that's actually the opposite of the proposition behind the holographic principle, which suggests that our perceived universe is the volume, but it can be encoded on its lower dimensional surface. In ADS-CFT correspondence, the volume exhibits gravity via a type of string theory, while the surface exhibits no gravity, only a quantum field theory similar to the field theory behind the standard model. Part of the confusion comes from the fact that Meldesena's derivation is for a volume with four spatial dimensions, which would then have a 3D surface. So obviously, that doesn't directly correspond to our universe, but there's work to generalize it to the case of a 3D volume with a 2D surface. Related to that, musical ways ask whether, according to ADS-CFT correspondence, can we say that there would be no gravity on the surface of the 2 plus 1 Minkowski spacetime? So first, the surface in the current ADS-CFT spacetime is 3 plus 1, 3 spatial, 1 temporal dimensions, as I just mentioned. That surface contains only a conformal field theory and no gravity. The strange miracle of ADS-CFT is that gravity arises naturally when you add the extra spatial dimension, which ends up looking like the volume contained by a 3D surface. KI9 asks whether the things we learn from ADS-CFT are applicable to our universe given that our universe doesn't have negative curvature. Well, we don't know for sure that it doesn't have negative curvature, just that any curvature negative or positive, is very weak compared to our current ability to measure it. Measurements of the geometry of the universe indicate flatness. But we may never know whether it's truly flat or just flat as far as we can see. Several people were offended that I dissed Chronicles of Riddick. Well, I want to be on record as saying that Pitch Black was an artistic masterpiece. Real mammal summarizes my position well. Chronicles is the third best Riddick movie, but it's still better than any Marvel movie. And I'm sure saying this will cause no further comments. Cuolito notices that it's looking more and more likely that Roger Penrose might literally be a time lord. In a separate comment, mid-plane wanderer states that Sir Roger Penrose is an unsung wizard. So apparently we can't agree on what genre Roger Penrose belongs to. Personally, I've always thought of him as a Jedi master, especially with all of that dubious quantum consciousness stuff, midichlorians, microtubules, potato potato. Anyway, perhaps we need to accept that Penrose is beyond genre, like if Gandalf had a TARDIS and a lightsaber. By the way, if anyone feels like drawing Roger Penrose dressed as Gandalf with a lightsaber and a TARDIS, you would win the internet.", "transcript_length": 2662, "reference_summary": "The concept of our universe being three-dimensional in space and one-dimensional in time is a deeply ingrained intuition, yet physics suggests this perception may be overly simplistic.

This idea emerged from decades of theoretical exploration, beginning with black hole thermodynamics and the work of Jacob Bekenstein, who established that a black hole's entropy\u2014representing the quantum information of everything that has fallen into it\u2014depends on the surface area of the black hole rather than its volume. Stephen Hawking's discovery of Hawking radiation further complicated this understanding, leading to the black hole information paradox, which questions the fate of quantum information. Gerard 't Hooft and Leonard Susskind proposed that this information could be encoded on the black hole's event horizon, suggesting a dual existence for objects inside a black hole: they are both three-dimensional and represented on a two-dimensional surface. This insight hints at a holographic nature of spacetime, where all information about a volume can be stored on a lower-dimensional boundary, a concept further developed through string theory and the ADS-CFT correspondence. Ultimately, this exploration challenges our fundamental understanding of dimensions and reality itself.", "channel": "PBS Space Time"}

Over the last 300 years, we've developed amazing new ways to harness energy, and we've used this ability to transform our environment. But all these structures that we see around us are just one type of visible order that we've created here on planet Earth. There's another type of invisible order, every bit as complex that we're only now beginning to understand. It's something that nature has been harnessing for billions of years. we call information. The concept of information is a very strange one. It's actually a very difficult idea to get your head round. But in the journey to try and understand it, scientists would discover that information is actually a fundamental part of our universe. This film is the story of information and the immense power released from manipulating it. It's the story of how we discovered the power of symbols and how writing, codes and computers would revolutionise our understanding of the universe. It's the story of how in a cosmos collapsing into disorder, information can be used to create order and structure. The first time I saw it, I thought, I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. I'm going to be a real man. We constantly exchange it between each other. But information has been one of the subtlest and most difficult concepts that science has had to grapple with. Understanding and harnessing it has been an extremely long and difficult process. The power of information would first be glimpsed over 5,000 years ago, when a revolutionary technology was developed. that would set the modern world in motion. Over the years, mankind has come up with some pretty remarkable stuff. But, of all humanity's inventions, there's one that really stands out. It's the most transformative, disruptive, creative technology ever conceived. and it's also one of the simplest. That invention is the written word. At its heart, writing is all about the transmission and storage of information. TICKING Words allow ideas to endure through time. These are some of the earliest texts in existence, and they give us an incredible insight into the development of writing. I've come to meet one of the few people who can still read them, Dr Irving Finkel. We take writing so much for granted these days that I guess it's easy to forget that it was invented. It certainly was. How did it first come about? The earliest writing that we have is written on play tablets, and it comes from Iraq, ancient Mesopotamia, and it comes from the culture of the Sumerians. And what happened here was that they started off with purely pictographic signs to express an idea. And this lasted for quite a long time until it occurred to somebody, perhaps accidentally, that what you could do is to make one of these graphic symbols on the surface of the clay, not for what it looked like, but for what the sound it represented was. So not a picture of an object, a picture of a sound. That's what we always call the giant leap for mankind. By combining different sounding pictures, the ancient Mesopotamians could express any idea imaginable. The essence of their breakthrough was to see, for example, that a picture of an eye and a picture of a deer didn't have to mean an eye and a deer. The pictures could be used simply for the sounds they made, in this case, idea. Once this system was discovered, it meant anything that could be spoken, even the most strange or abstract thoughts, could be transformed into symbols. and could now live outside of the human brain. And this meant it could endure over vast spans of time. It was an idea that fascinated the ancient Mesopotamians. This lovely tablet here, this king, Orinamu, lived in about 2100 BC. He buried this in the foundations of this temple as a message for the future. with King Oranamu, the powerful male, King of Ur, King of Sumer and Akkad, so that's the south and the north part of ancient Mesopotamia. Her house, he built for her, and he even restored it afterwards. So this is a proud thing, and he wants everybody to know about it, and this is a real message for the future. What's so remarkable for me is that this is information stored on clay for thousands of years. Yes. that someone had 4,000 years ago are still there. You have ideas, you have speech, you have human hopes, you have literature, you have prayers, you have all these sorts of outpourings of the human soul fixed forever in clay. By turning sounds into symbols, the Mesopotamian scribes had discovered that information could be changed very easily from one form to another. From something that existed as spoken sounds to something that existed as symbols on clay tablets. But this was just the beginning. Humans were yet to realise the true power of symbols. For 4,000 years, writing was pretty much the only information technology people used. But in the 19th century, during the great industrial revolution, things would begin to change. In the maelstrom of ideas and inventions, a series of seemingly unconnected technologies would emerge that all began to hint at the immense power of information. These technologies would all come from very practical, very un-theoretical origins, but they would start to reveal that information was a much deeper and more powerful concept than anyone had realised. of the first of a new breed of information technologies would be developed in the French city of Lyon at the end of the 18th century. 18th century Lyon was home to some of the best craftsmen in the world. It was also a place of great opulence, grandeur and above all money. Thanks to the rich and fashionable aristocrats and bankers who lived there, it would become home to the greatest silk weaving industry in the world. Almost a third of the city's inhabitants worked in the silk industry and it was home to over 14,000 looms. This is brocade, the material that made Leon famous. It's a beautiful and intricately woven fabric that, as you might imagine, is incredibly labour-intensive to produce. A two-man team working flat out for a day could at best produce about an inch of this amazing stuff. The demand for the fine fabrics of Lyon was immense, but the silk weaving process was painfully slow. But thanks to a soldier and weaver named Joseph Marie Jacquard, a device will be developed to help speed up weaving. In the process, it would reveal a fundamental truth about information. on the work of a number of others. In 1804, Jacquard patented his invention. At the time, the loom was the most complex mechanism ever built by humankind. Jacquard's loom was a miracle of ingenuity. You see, he designed a single machine which, Any alteration to its construction, its hardware to use a modern term, could be programmed to weave any pattern a designer could think up. In fact, it could produce a whole range of silk designs with barely a pause in production. Jackard had found the holy grail of weaving, and a secret was a simple punched card. The punched card held within it the essence of the designs that the loom would weave. When these punched cards were fed into the loom, they would act to lower and lift the relevant threads. recreating the pattern in silk. Any design you could think of could be broken down and translated into a series of punch cards and could then be woven by the loom. Information was being translated from picture to punch card to the finished fabric. It is a machine for weaving textiles. That's its tasks. But there is nothing specific about what textiles it should weave. That is contained in the information which is encoded on the cards. So if you like the cards, program it. That is to say, instruct it what to do. And this has huge resonances for what came later. Jack Hard's loom revolutionized the silk industry. But at its heart was something deeper, something more universal than its industrial origins and its ability to speed up weaving. The loom revealed the power of abstracting information. It showed that you can take the essence of something, extract the vital information and represent it in another form. Writing had revealed you could use a set of symbols to capture spoken language. Now, Jacquard had shown that with just two symbols, a whole or a blank space, it was possible to capture the information in any picture imaginable. to the information in any picture imaginable. This is a portrait of Jakob that's been woven in silk. It's spectacularly detailed with hundreds of thousands of stitches. And yet, all the information you need to capture this lifelike image can be stored in a series of punched cards. 24,000 of them to be precise. This picture is a fantastic example of a really far-reaching idea. That the simplest of systems, in this case, cards with a series of holes punched in them, can capture the essence of something much, much more complicated. If 24,000 punch cards could create an image like this, what would happen if you had 24 million? or 24 trillion cards. What new types of complex information might be able to be captured and represented? Gjakard had stumbled on an incredibly deep and far-reaching idea. As long as you have enough of them, simple symbols can be used to describe anything in the entire universe. Translating information into abstract symbols to store and process had proven to be an extremely powerful idea. But the way information was sent, the way it was communicated, hadn't changed for thousands of years. The world before telecommunications technology was a very different place, because you could only send messages as fast as you could send objects. So you'd write a message on a piece of paper or something like that, and then you'd either give it to somebody who could run very fast, or could go on a horse, or on a ship very fast. But the point was, you could only send information as fast as you could send matter. But in the 19th century, the speed at which information could be sent would dramatically increase, thanks to an incredible new information-carrying medium, electricity. Very soon after electricity was discovered, excitement grew about its potential as a medium to transmit messages. It seemed that if it could be controlled and summoned at will, Electricity would be the perfect medium for sending information. Electricity seemed to offer many advantages as a way of sending messages. It was sent down a wire, which means it could pretty much go anywhere. It wasn't affected by bad weather conditions, and most importantly, it could move very quickly. But there was one big problem facing those in the early 19th century who wanted to use electricity as a means to communicate. How could such a simple signal be used to send complex messages? Here in the Science Museum Archive, they have one of the most impressive collections of early electronic communications technology in the world. Here are just some of the early devices designed to send signals using electricity. This one's particularly fun. It was developed in 1809 in Bavaria by Samuel Somering. So if the sender wants to send letter A, he sends a current through that corresponding wire. At the receiver's end is a tank full of liquid, and the electric current forces a chemical reaction, causing bubbles to appear above the corresponding letter A. The whole process is ingenious if a little laborious. But what's really fun is that the sender has to let the receiver know he's about to send a signal. He does that by sending extra electric current so that more bubbles appear, forcing an arm upwards, which releases a ball... ..and triggers a bell. As you can imagine, this wouldn't be the quickest of systems. After sombering, all sorts of approaches were taken in trying to crack the problem of sending messages using electricity. But they all suffered from having over-complex codes. These devices, each cunning and innovative in its own way, were all destined for the scrap heap of history. And that's because in the 1840s, they were superseded by a way of sending signals that still endures to this day. It was developed by artist and entrepreneur Samuel Morse, together with his colleague Alfred Vale. What was so special about their system wasn't the technology that was used to carry their messages, but the incredibly simple and effective code they used to send them. Just like Jacquard's punch cards, the genius of Morse and Vale's code lay in its simplicity. Using a collection of short and long pulses of electrical current, they could spell out the letters of the alphabet. Vale suggested that the most frequent letters in the English language get the shortest code. So an E is sent like this, while an X is sent like this. This means that messages can be sent quickly and efficiently. Figuring out the code part of it, the software, if you like, was as complicated as figuring out the hardware side of things with the batteries and the wires. And together they made an entirely new technology, which was the electric telegraph. The telegraph had once again revealed the power of translating information from one medium to another. Information had at first been fixed in human brains, then held in symbols in clay and paper and punched cards. Now, thanks to Morse, information could reside in electricity, and this made it unimaginably lighter and quicker than it had ever been before. In just a few short years, the telegraph network would spread around the entire globe, laying the foundations of the modern information age. them, Jacquard and Morse had found new and novel ways to manipulate, process and transmit information. What had begun with the invention of writing thousands of years ago had culminated in the binding of the entire planet in a lattice of wires carrying highly abstracted information at incredible speeds. For people at the end of the 19th century, it may have seemed that humanity's ability to manipulate and transmit information was at its zenith. They couldn't have been more wrong. Information would reveal itself to be a more important, more fundamental concept than anyone could have imagined. It would soon become apparent that information wasn't just about human communication. It was a much further reaching idea than that. The true nature of information would first be hinted at thanks to a strange problem, one dreamed up by a brilliant Scottish physicist who appeared to be thinking about something else entirely. MUSIC James Clark Maxwell was one of the great minds of the 19th century. Among his many interests, Maxwell became fascinated by the science of thermodynamics, the study of heat and motion that had sprung up with the birth of the steam engine. Maxwell was one of the first to understand that heat is really just the motion of molecules. The hotter something is, the faster its molecules are moving. This idea would lead Maxwell to dream up a very bizarre thought experiment in which information played a crucial role. Maxwell theorised that simply by knowing what's going on inside a box full of air, it would be possible to make one half hotter and the other half colder. Think of it like building an oven next to a fridge without using any energy. It sounds crazy, but Maxwell's argument was extremely persuasive. It goes like this. Imagine a small demon perched on top of the box who has such excellent eyesight that he can observe accurately the motion of all the molecules of air inside the box. Now, crucially, he's in control of a partition that divides the box into two halves. Every time he sees a fast moving molecule approaching the partition from the right-hand side, he opens it up allowing it through to the left. And every time he sees a slow moving molecule approaching the partition from the left, he opens it up allowing the molecule through to the right. Now, you can see what's going to happen. Over time, all the fast-moving, hot molecules will accumulate on the left-hand side of the box and all the slow-moving, cold molecules on the right. Crucially, the demon has done this sorting with nothing more than information about the motion of the molecules. Maxwell's demon seemed to say that just by having information about the molecules, you could create order from disorder. This idea flew in the face of 19th century thinking. The science of thermodynamics had shown very clearly that over time, the entropy of the universe, its disorder, would always increase. Things were destined to fall apart. But the demon seemed to suggest that you could put things back together without using any energy at all. Just by using information, you could create order. It would prove to be a fiendishly difficult problem to solve, not least because the brilliant Maxwell had come up with an idea far, far ahead of its time. It's amazing the impact he had on physics and that he came up with this very intricate concept that he already, in some sense, pre-well anticipated the notion of information. That wasn't actually there at that time. There was no such thing. I think this idea was astonishing. He didn't really have a resolution. He raised it as a concern and he left it open. And I think what followed is more or less 120 years of extremely exciting debates and developments to try to resolve and address this concern. So, what was going on with Maxwell's demon? It may sound far-fetched and fanciful, but imagine the possibilities if we could build a machine in the real world that could mimic the actions of the demon. I could use it to heat a cup of coffee, or to run an engine, or to power a city, all using nothing more than pure information. It's as though we could create order in the universe without expending any energy. Scientists felt intuitively that it had to be wrong. The problem was it would take over 100 years to solve the problem. While Maxwell's riddle rumbled on, something quite unexpected was to happen. A new device was dreamt up that could perform quite incredible and complex tasks simply by processing information. What's more, this was a device that could actually be built. the machine would come to be known as the computer, and the idea behind it came from a quite remarkable and visionary scientist. Alan Turing was the first person to conceive of the modern computer, A machine whose sole function is to manipulate and process information. A machine that harnesses the power of abstract symbols. A machine that enables almost every aspect of the modern world. Turing's incredible idea would first appear in a now legendary mathematical paper published in 1936. In his brief life, Alan Turing brought fresh groundbreaking ideas to a whole range of topics, from cryptography through to biology. The sheer breadth of his thinking is breathtaking. But for most scientists, it's the concepts he outlined in these 36 pages that mark him out as truly special. It's this work that makes him worthy of the title genius. Published when Turing was just 24 years old, on computable numbers with an application to the Enshidles problem, tackles the foundations of mathematical logic. What's amazing about it is that the idea for the modern computer emerged simply as a consequential of Turing's brilliant reasoning. He was thinking about something else entirely. He wasn't, you know, sort of sitting there thinking, I want to try and invent the modern computer. He was thinking about this very abstract problem in the foundations of mathematics, and the computer kind of fell sideways out of that research completely unexpectedly. I mean, nobody could have guessed that Turing's, you know, very abstract, abstruse research in the foundations of mathematics could produce anything of any practical value whatsoever, let alone a machine that was going to change the lives of nearly everyone on the planet. Turing had set out to understand if certain processes in mathematics could be done simply by following a set of rules. And this is what would get him thinking about computers. In 1936, the word computer had a very different meaning to what it does today. It meant a real person with a pencil and paper engaged in arithmetical calculations. Banks hired many such people, often women, to work out interest payments. The Inland Revenue employed them to work out how much tax to charge. hired them to calculate navigational data. Human computers were vital to the modern world, dealing with the huge amounts of information produced as science and industry grew ever more complex. What Turing did in his 1936 paper was ask a simple but profound question. What goes on in the mind of a person carrying out a computation. To do this, he first had to discard all the superfluous details so that only the very essence of the process of computation remained. So first off, went the ink pot, then the pen, then the slide rule, then the pencils, and the pads of paper. All these things made it easier, but none of them were absolutely crucial to the person carrying out the computation. Now Turing asked, what goes on in the brain of a human computer? It's a vastly complex biological system capable of consciousness, thoughts, and insights, but to Turing, none of these was critical to the process of computation either. Turing realized that to compute something, a set of rules had to be followed precisely. That was all. It takes the higher level intelligence that was presupposed to be involved in calculation which is thinking and says you can have a mechanical process. That is, by mechanical, it means an unthinking process to perform the same act and therefore eliminates the necessity of human agency with all its high level functions. And that is what is revolutionary about what he tries to do. Turing's brilliant mind saw that any calculation had two aspects, the data and the instructions for what to do with the data. And this would be the key to his insight. Turing had to find a way of getting machines to understand instructions like ads, subtract, multiply, divide and so on, in the same way that humans do. In other words, he had to find a way of translating instructions like these into a language that machines could understand. And with flawless, impeccable logic, Turing did exactly that. This may look like a random series of ones and zeros, but to a computing machine it's a set of instructions that can be read off step by step, telling the machine to behave in a certain way. So while a human computer could look at this symbol and understand the process that was required, the computing machine had to have it explained like this. This paper tape that Turing envisaged is what we would now call the memory of the computer. But Turing didn't stop there. Turing realised that feeding a machine instructions in this way had an amazing consequence. It meant that just one machine is needed to perform almost any task you can think of. It's a beautifully simple concept. In order to get the machine to do something new, all you had to do was feed it a new set of instructions, new information. This idea became known as the universal Turing machine. The more you wanted your machine to do, the longer the tape had to be. Bigger memories could hold complex, multi-layered instructions about how to process and order any kind of information imaginable. With a big enough memory, the computer will be capable of an almost limitless number of tasks. This idea of Turing's, that a multitude of different tasks can be carried out simply by giving a computing machine machine, a long sequence of instructions is his greatest legacy. Since his paper, Turing's dream has been realized. So calculations, making phone calls, recording moving images, writing letters, listening to music, none of these require bespoke machines. They can all be carried out on a single device, a computing machine. This phone is a modern incarnation of Turing's amazing idea. Inside here are many, many instructions, what we'd call programs or software or apps. There are nothing more than a long sequence of numbers telling the phone what to do. What's amazing about Turing's idea is its incredible scope. The sets of instructions that can be fed to a computer could tell it how to mimic telephones or typewriters. but they could also describe the rules of nature, the laws of physics, the processes of the natural world. This is a simulation of many millions of particles behaving like a fluid. To work out how it flows, the computer simply follows a set of instructions held in its memory. This only begins to hint at the power of computing machines. This is a computer simulation of the large-scale structure of the entire universe, and it reveals the true power of Turing's idea. Turning instructions into symbols that a machine can understand allows you to recreate not just a simple picture or sound, but a process, a system, something that is changing and evolving. By manipulating simple symbols, computers are capable of capturing the essence, the order of the natural world itself. By thinking about how the human brain processes and computes information, Alan Turing had had one of the most important ideas of the 20th century. The power of information was revealing itself. It would be very easy to think that after Turing's ideas were made real, the true power of information would be unleashed. But Turing was only half the story. The modern information age would require another idea, one that would finally pin down the nature of information and its relationship to the order and disorder of the universe. It was an idea that would be dreamt up by a gifted and eccentric mathematician and engineer. MUSIC Claude Shannon was a true maverick, and his desire to tackle unusual problems would lead to a revolutionary new idea, one that would uncover the fundamental nature of information and the process of communication in all its varied forms. This is Claude Shannon's paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Now, the title may sound a bit dry, but trust me, it's one of the most important scientific papers of the 20th century. Not only did it lay the foundations for the Modern World Communication Network, it also gave us fresh insights into human language, into things we do intuitively, like speaking and writing. The paper was published in 1948, while Shannon was working at the Bell Labs in New Jersey, the research arm of the vast Bell telephone network. It was an institution famous for its forward-thinking, relaxed atmosphere. The mathematicians were free to work on any problem that interested them. The only thing that the laboratory management required of them is that they keep an open door, and if anybody from any other department came with a problem, that they would at least think about it. Otherwise, they were absolutely free, and the atmosphere, the atmosphere was incredible. People were playing and encouraged to play. Hello, I'm Claude Shannon, a mathematician here at the Belkullifal Laboratory. Shannon in particular was given free reign to do pretty much whatever he wanted. This is Thesus. Thesus is an electrically controlled mouse. Oh, they treated him as their darling. I never saw him juggle, but I certainly saw him right as unicycle. He brought it to work one day and he must have cost Bell Ebb's at least a hundred man hours of time. But despite the frivolity, the Bell telephone network faced a huge problem. Every day they transmitted vast amounts of electronic information all across the world. But they had no real idea of how to measure this information properly or how to quantify it. In short, their entire business was built on something they didn't actually understand. stand. Amazingly, their superstar employee, Claude Shannon, would give them exactly what they needed. In this paper, Shannon did something absolutely incredible. He took the vague and mysterious concept of information and managed to pin it down. Now he didn't do this using some cleverly worded philosophical definition, he actually found a way to measure the information contained in a message. Can I get this? Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick There would be no news at all, and the information content would be zero. So suddenly you have a relationship between unexpectedness and information. But Shannon was to go further and give information its very own unit of measurement. So how did he do this? Well, he showed that any message you care to send could be translated into binary digits, a long sequence of ones and zeros. So a simple greeting like hello could be written like this or like this. Let's think of this as another way of writing the same message. MUSIC Shannon realised that transforming information into binary digits would be an immensely powerful act. It would make information manageable, exact, controllable and precise. In his paper, Shannon showed that a single binary digit, one of these ones or zeros, is a fundamental unit of information. Think of it as an atom of information, the smallest possible piece. Then, having defined this basic unit, he even gave us a name for it, one we're all familiar with today. He used a shortening of the phrase binary digit, bit. binary digit, bit. The humble bit turned out to be an enormously powerful idea. The bit as the smallest quantity of information, it is highly significant because it's the fundamental atom. It is the smallest unit of information in which there is sufficient discrimination to communicate anything at all. The power of the bit lay in its universality. Any system that has two states, like a coin with heads or tails, can carry one bit of information. One or zero, punched or not punched, on or off, stop or go. All of these systems can store one bit of information. Thanks to Shannon, the bit became the common language of all information. Anything, sounds, pictures, text, can be turned into bits and transmitted by any system capable of being in just two states. Shannon had founded a new far-reaching theory. The ideas he began to explore would form the cornerstone of what we now call information theory. He'd taken an abstract concept, information, and turn it into something tangible. What had been just a vague notion was now measurable, something real. The idea of converting into bits, into making things digital, would fundamentally transform many aspects of human society. But information isn't just something humans create. We're beginning to understand that this concept lies at the heart not only of 21st century human society, but also at the heart of the physical world itself. Every bit of information we've ever created, every book, every film, the entire contents of the internet amounts to pretty much nothing when compared with the information content of nature. And that's because even the most insignificant event contains a spectacular amount of information. Let me show you. Imagine how many bits of information you would need to describe this. beautiful and intricate interplay of physical laws taking place at scales and timeframes that are normally imperceptible to us. But here, you're still only seeing a fraction of the complexity of nature. Imagine the interplay between the trillions upon trillions of atoms. The amount of bits you would need to describe this is almost unimaginable. What's amazing is that now, thanks to the ideas of Turing and Shannon, we're able to describe, model and simulate nature in ever greater detail. But this isn't the end of the story. Information, it seems, isn't just a way of describing reality. In the last few years, we've discovered that information is actually an inseparable part of the physical world. It's a really difficult idea to get to grips with, but information, everything from a Beethoven symphony to the contents of a dictionary, even a fleeting thought, All information needs to be embodied in some form of physical system. Amazingly, the reason we understand the true connection between information and reality is because of Maxwell's demon. Remember, it seemed like the demon could use information to create order in a box of air of air that started out completely disordered. Moreover, it could do this without expending any effort. Information seemed to be able to break the laws of physics. Well, that's not true. It can't. The reason why Maxwell's demon can't get energy for free lies here. in his head. What was discovered was this. The demon really is using nothing more than information to create useful energy. But this doesn't mean that he's getting something for nothing. Remember how the demon works? He spots a fast-moving molecule on one side of the box, opens a partition and lets it through to the other side. But each time he does that, he has to store information about that molecule's speed in his memory. Soon, his memory will fill up, and then he can only continue if he starts deleting information. Crucially, this deletion would require him to expend energy. The demon needs to keep a record of which molecules are moving where, and if the record-keeping device is only finite size, at some point the neem is going to have to erase it. That's an irreversible process that increases the entropy of the universe. It's the erasure of information that increases entropy once and for all. What was discovered is that there's a certain specific minimum amount of energy known as the land-hour limit that's required to delete one bit of information. It's tiny, less than a trillion trillionth of the amount of energy in a gram of sugar, but it's real. It's a part of the fundamental fabric of the universe. Amazingly, we can now do real experiments that test aspects of Maxwell's idea. By using lasers and tiny particles of dust, scientists around the world have explored the relationship between information and energy with incredible accuracy. Maxwell's thought experiment, dreamt up in the age of steam, still remains at the cutting edge of scientific research today. Maxwell's demon links together two of the most important concepts in science, the study of energy and the study of information, and shows that the two are profoundly linked. What we now know is that information, far from being some abstract concept, obeys the the same laws of physics as everything else in the universe. Information is not just an abstraction, just a mathematical thing or a formula that you write on the paper. Actually, information is carried by something, so it's encoded onto something, a stone, a book, a CD, whatever. There's a carrier where the information is on. And that means that information behaves according to the laws of physics. So it cannot break the laws of physics. What humanity has learnt over the last few millennia is that information can never be divorced from the physical world. But this is not a hindrance. What makes information so powerful is the fact it can be stored in any physical system we choose. From using stone and clay to allow information to be preserved over eons, to using electricity and light so it can be sent quickly, the medium that stores information gives it unique properties. Today, scientists are exploring new ways of manipulating information, using everything from DNA to quantum particles. They hope that this work will usher in a new information age, every bit as transformative as the last. What we now know is that we're just at the beginning of our journey to unlock the power of information. It's always been clear that creating physical order, the structures we see around us, has a cost. We need to do work to expend energy to build them. But in the last few years, We've learnt that ordering information, creating the invisible digital structures of the modern world also has an inescapable cost. As abstract and ethereal as information seems, we now know it must always be embodied in a physical system. I find this an incredibly exciting idea. Think about it this way. A lump of clay can be used to write a poem on. of air can carry the sound of a symphony and a single photon is like a paintbrush. Every aspect of the physical universe can be thought of as a blank canvas which we can use to build beauty, structure and order.", "transcript_length": 6350, "reference_summary": "The film explores the profound concept of information, highlighting its dual nature as both a visible and invisible order that shapes our world. Over the past 300 years, humanity has harnessed energy to create structures, but the film emphasizes that information, a fundamental aspect of the universe, has been utilized by nature for billions of years. It traces the evolution of information from its early manifestations in writing to its revolutionary impact on society through symbols, codes, and computers. The narrative underscores the significance of the written word, which emerged over 5,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia, where Sumerians transitioned from pictographic signs to a phonetic system that allowed for the expression of complex ideas. This breakthrough enabled thoughts to be recorded and shared across time, fundamentally transforming human communication and understanding. The film illustrates how, amidst a cosmos prone to disorder, information serves as a tool for creating order and structure, marking it as one of humanity's most transformative inventions. Through the lens of history and technology, the film invites viewers to appreciate the intricate relationship between information and the development of civilization.", "channel": "Spark"}

How big is it? Does it have a center? Does it have an edge? Is it getting bigger? And if so, why? Well, we know that there are two different meanings for universe. First, the observable universe is everything that we've been able to see or observe thus far. And second, the universe, or the whole universe, means everything that exists or has existed or will exist. More specifically, the observable universe is the region of space visible to us from Earth. And since the universe is only about 13.8 billion years old, and light takes time to travel through space, then regardless of what direction we look, we see light that's been traveling at most 13.8 billion years. So it's logical to think that the observable universe must then be 2 times 13.77 equals 27.5 billion light years across. But it's not. That's because over time, space has been expanding, so the distant objects that gave off that light 13.8 billion years ago have since moved even farther away from us. Today, those distant objects are a bit more than 46 billion light-years away. Multiply times 2 and you get 93 billion light-years, the diameter of the observable universe. To give you a sense of scale, the size of the Earth within the observable universe is roughly equivalent to the size of a virus within the solar system. Although that doesn't help much because we can't really appreciate the incomprehensible smallness of a virus nor the bewildering bigness of our solar system either. So let's just say that the observable universe is stupendously big. But the whole universe, as far as we can tell, is a lot bigger. Space is most likely infinite, or at least it doesn't have an edge, though the difference between those is another story unto itself. Now what about the center of the universe? Well the observable universe has a center. Us, we are at the center of the observable universe because the observable universe is just the region of space visible from Earth. And kind of like how the view from a very tall tower is a circle centered on the tower, piece of space we can see from here is naturally centered here. In fact, if you want to be more precise, each one of us is the center of our own observable universe. But that doesn't mean we're at the center of the whole universe, just like the tower isn't the center of the world. It's the center of the piece of the world that it can see, up to the horizon. But just because you can't see beyond the horizon doesn't mean there's nothing there. And so it is with the observable universe. Looking up at the sky, we see light that's at most 13.8 billion years old and coming from stuff that's now 46 billion light years away. Anything farther is beyond the horizon. But each second we see new, even older light coming from slightly farther away, three light seconds farther to be precise. And so our view of the cosmos is literally getting bigger all the time. All we have to do is wait and watch as the universe ages and light from more distant places has the time to get to us. So here we are, sitting at the center of our observable piece of the whole universe. How big is the universe? Well, the observable universe is currently 93 billion light-years across. The whole universe is probably infinite. Does the universe have an edge? The observable universe does. It's 46 billion light-years away in any direction, and the whole universe has a temporal edge or what we call a beginning, but almost certainly not a spatial one. Does the universe have a center? Again, the observable universe does. You. The universe as a whole? Almost certainly not. And is the universe getting bigger? Yes, space is expanding, which makes both the observable universe and the whole universe bigger. Plus, over time, we see older and older light coming from farther and farther away. So our observable universe gets bigger that way, too. And that, in a nutshell, is our view from the tower. You are the center of the universe. And so am I. And so is everyone else. And so is no one.

The observable universe is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter, despite being only 13.8 billion years old, due to the expansion of space. As light from distant objects takes time to reach us, those objects have moved farther away over time. Each observer is at the center of their own observable universe, similar to how a tall tower has a circular view centered on itself. However, this does not imply that we are at the center of the entire universe, which is likely infinite and lacks a defined edge. While the observable universe has a spatial boundary, the whole universe does not, and it is continuously expanding. As we observe light from increasingly distant sources, our understanding of the cosmos expands. Ultimately, while the observable universe is immense, the entirety of the universe is likely far larger, and we are all, in a sense, the center of our own cosmic perspectives.", "channel": "minutephysics"}

Tonight, We're going to consider a difficult subject. I don't think you're surprised at that. We're going to consider the limits of human understanding with a particular focus on mathematics. Now, this is a science festival, and science is the most reliable way of gaining knowledge and understanding of the world. In the last four centuries, we've seen great advances in our understanding both the physical and the biological worlds, but what are the limits of this understanding? This is a question philosophers have pondered over the centuries, traditionally worrying about areas such as the validity of induction, that is inferring generalizations and general laws, or the reliability or even the validity of our senses in generating information about the world. Now, tonight we are likely to touch on such philosophical issues, but our main focus will be on mathematics and on mathematical logic. Because mathematics and mathematical thinking underpins much that is important in science. It's been the cornerstone of physics since the 17th century, particularly since Isaac Newton. Indeed, some aspects of physics, particularly 20th century physics like quantum mechanics and theories of the ultimate structure of matter, only make sense in terms of mathematics. They are not part of our common sense world. Turning even to biology in the last 50 years, it's gradually being realized that DNA is essentially a digital information storage device. And it's become clear that the way information is managed in living systems will be key to biological understanding. It's my own view that given the complexity of biological information and its management, I wonder if we may not end up in strange places analogous to quantum mechanics in physics. But as well as underpinning science, mathematics and logic appears to be the most secure sphere of human understanding. It's based on a firm structure of axioms and of proofs. It seems to be a most reliable and self-contained part of human knowledge. But tonight we shall see that this is not quite as straightforward as it seems. Godel in the first half of the last century showed that mathematics was not always provably consistent. In fact some mathematical facts can never be proven to be true or to be false. They are mathematical paradoxes, analogous to literary paradoxes. May be therefore the relationship between truth and mathematics is more tenuous than we thought. This, ladies and gentlemen, is our territory tonight. So let's begin with a video about Godel. In 1920, amidst the wreckage of war-torn Europe, David Hilbert, the most influential mathematician of his time, to call to scholars everywhere to prove the consistency of mathematics. The country is in ruins in a lot of ways and so part of what they're seeking is emancipation from that and they're seeking a vehicle to the future where science and math was going to be the promise of a golden era. A lot of the mathematicians at the time really believed that they would be able to prove what Hilbert asked of them, which is that mathematics and arithmetic was going to be provably consistent. And so it was really quite a blow when a young and soft-spoken gentlemanly student from the university comes and declares that actually it's not true. It was a 24-year-old doctoral student named Kurt Goedl who exposed the limitation of mathematics. His ideas would shake the very foundations of mathematics and philosophy. The culmination of Goedl's ideas are called the incompleteness theorems. There are mathematical facts that we can never prove are true or false. There is no such thing as a mathematical theory of everything. And they are one of the most significant results ever to be proven in mathematics. G\u00f6tel wasn't completely well. He was a severe hypochondriac, bordering on paranoid schizophrenia. He had bouts in mental institutions. Numbers, mathematics, he believed was real. wasn't so sure about the truth of his senses and perception of reality. By 1939, with Europe descending into a Second World War, Gerdl fled Vienna for Princeton. He was invited to become a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study. Gerdl in some ways was very charming and very gentlemanly, but he was also extremely reticent and very withdrawn at times. He had this deep devotion to truth, and he was his own thinker in that sense. Nothing would sway him. And one of his very few friends was Einstein. Einstein, well, being a very different person, also had a similar incredible independence of mind. There must have been a way in which they respected each other on those grounds, where they could see in each other that complete independence of mind. Though no one understood the nature of their friendship or the depth of their conversation, toward the end of his life, Einstein felt that his own work no longer meant much. He came to the Institute merely to have the privilege of walking home with G\u00fcrtel. In the end, paranoia and an obsessive fear of being poisoned led G\u00fcrtel to starve himself. He died in a Princeton hospital weighing just 65 pounds at the age of 72. I think in his fear and anxiety about his physical life, physical pain he felt, the paranoia about his health. His dream was that it was a reward to in the next life be presented with a pure, more platonic reality. He was a very tragic figure. So, could I ask the panelists to come out on stage please? So I'm just going to say a few words about each of them, starting with the gentleman immediately to my left, Gregory Chaitin. He is a mathematician and computer scientist, chief architect of algorithmic information theory which relates to the computing of complexity. He's also the discoverer of the omega number. And we may hear more about that later. He's at the forefront of the emerging metobiology field, which regards life as a sort of biochemical software. He's the author of a dozen books about mathematics and philosophy, including thinking about Godel and Turing. He worked for many years at the IBM Watson Research Center in New York, where he is currently emeritus. Just to his left, Rebecca Goldstein, a philosopher and author. As a philosopher, her areas of speciality are philosophy of science, mathematical logic, and 17th century rationalism. Her first novel, the Mind Body Problem, more novels followed. But among her works of nonfiction is the biography of incompleteness, the proof and paradox of Kurt G\u00f6del. She's chosen by Discover magazine as one of the 10 best science books of 2006. Her latest novel, and I've read this one, is 36 arguments for the existence of God, a work of fiction. She has been a professor of both philosophy and of writing and is currently in the Department of Psychology at Harvard. To her left, Mario Livio, senior astrophysicist, head of the Office of Public Outreach at the Space Telescope Science Institute responsible for the Hubble Space Telescope. An author of award-winning books including the Golden Ratio, the story of Phi, the world's most astonishing number, and Is God a Mathematician, selected by The Washington Post as one of the best books for 2009. His research focuses on supernova explosions and the nature of dark energy. And finally on his left Marvin Minsky, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence who's made numerous contributions to the fields of AI, cognitive, psychology, mathematics, linguistics, robotics and optics. He has talked about the human intellectual structure and function in his books, The Emotion Machine and the Society of Mind and also built the SNARK, the first neural network simulator. His other inventions include robotic devices and he is the recipient of numerous prizes and awards for his work. Dr. Minsky is a professor at MIT where he co-founded the artificial intelligence lab. A great line up and welcome to all of I want to start with Rebecca, if I could. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about Godel and also the environment in which he was living, the intellectual environment in Europe following the First World War. Well, he came. He was born in a Czech town. His family spoke German. And he came to Vienna in the 20s. And Vienna at that time was a city of extraordinary intellectual and artistic fervent, tremendous amount of rethinking from the foundations up. Things had not worked out so very well. World War I. And there was a sense of having to begin anew. And one of the centers of this thinking was a place that we now, I actually kind of think of Vienna as sort of the New York of its day. You know, it was kind of, everything was happening there and very much not in sync with the rest of the country. You were Viennese and like you're a New Yorker. And it was something that we now call the Vienna Circle. And it was a group of, we now associate with, a movement in philosophy and in science called logical positivism. And this was a movement that was trying to, again, think things through from the bottom up, make things very, very clear. So they had a criterion for meaningfulness, that the meaning of a proposition is given by the conditions that would verify it. And if there are propositions that no experience would count for or against, it was a meaningless proposition. So meaninglessness was a term of damnation that they used very, very often. And this was a center, this circle of, there were scientists, there were philosophers, there were mathematicians. And there were two young graduate students. They had been invited by a mathematician who was a leader of the Vienna Circle Hans Hahn. And he had two graduate students, one of whom was named Kirt Gittel, and was a very, very quiet man and didn't say very much. This group was also reverentially in awe of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein was their hero. He was their God. And they had a certain view about the foundations of mathematics. What made mathematics true? They hated mystery and mathematics presents a certain degree of mystery. How do we know it's true? How do we... It's a kind of certainty and a horribility and infallibility. How does it come to the likes of us? Is it descriptive? Are we just making it up? They had a certain view of mathematics given by David Hilbert, formalism. And that's why they attached the word logical to their positivism. They were embracing Hilbert's view. And this was the environment in which this young goodel sat there keeping his counsel, not really speaking. He disagreed with them entirely. but he didn't say it until he had a proof in completeness. And what was that proof? Well, so the big mystery of course in mathematics is what's it all about? Mathis, there's a certain degree of mystery here because it's not empirical. It can't, it's not going to be revised in the face of anything further that we're going to learn about the world. That's why mathematicians are cheap to hire. They don't require observatories. They don't require laboratories. It's all in the cranium. And it's done a priori, a proof from principles, from first principles. And so the question is, in the way I often think of it, is that old Carl, not Carl, the other Marx, Groucho Marx. She hoped that I wouldn't have any club that would have me. I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member. I mean, in mathematics is how did we get invited to join this exclusive cognitive club? How do the likes of us have this kind of certainty? Are we just making it up? Are these just stipulated rules? Is it just a higher form of chess? That was the formalist school. Or is it descriptive of something? Goodall tried to put forth a theorem, a mathematically proved theorem, rigorously proved, that would address this metamathematical question. So that's the interest of this thing. That's why it seems, it seems to be mathematics that spills out beyond mathematics. It tells us something perhaps about the nature of mathematical truth, the nature of knowledge, the nature of us as knowers, perhaps. Here's what it actually says. I mean, there are two of them. And the second one follows as a corollary from the first. So here's the first. In any formal system, you may want me to go on and define what a formal system is. Yeah, tell us what a formal system is. A formal system is something that is stipulated by rules. You stipulate the axioms, I mean, you stipulate the alphabet. Here's the alphabet of this thing. You stipulate how you can combine the alphabet into meaningful things. So baseball is a form of... Yeah, and you don't worry about what it all means. It's something that's purely computational, a formal system is something that's mechanical, it's rules that could be programmed into a computer perhaps. It's a purely computational mechanical way. You don't have to worry about what it all means. That's a very vague, informal description of what a formal system is. In any formal system, and what formalism wanted to do was to reduce all of mathematics to formal systems, to just show it's just a purely mechanical thing following from stipulated rules. In that way, dispel the mystery. Okay, Goethe's first incompleteness theorem. In any formal system that is rich enough to express arithmetic, there will exist a proposition which is, you can express, which is undecidable, meaning neither it, nor its negation can be proved in that system. Another way of saying this, a little more controversial is that in any formal system, rich enough to express arithmetic, there are true propositions that can't be proved. And the second incompleteness theorem, which was immediate, but everybody saw the relevance of immediately because of what Hilbert had said needed to be done, proving the consistency of arithmetic. The second incompleteness theorem, which is a corollary of the first says, One of the things that you can't prove in a formal system is the consistency of that system. And consistency, again, informally, what this means, a system is inconsistent if you can prove, for some proposition, P, both P and not P. That is an inconsistent system. Inconsistent systems are useless because anything at all follows from a contradiction. So if you've got a system that can prove a contradiction, you can prove absolutely anything, existence of God, I mean anything. You can just prove anything from an inconsistent system. So, Goethe's second incompleteness theorem saying that within a system you can never prove the consistency of that system really was a blow to formalism. It really sounds rather shocking to me. I mean, how did the Viennese, or for that matter, the rest of the world take to this? Well, the very interesting thing is that when, so he had formed these great, he had these huge beliefs, Platonism, he believed that mathematics was descriptive of a trans-empirical realm. He wanted a mathematical proof that he felt was going to prove that, prove something metamathematically an audacious ambition that he may or may not have carried through on, but he certainly did something big. And he announced it at a conference in K\u00f6nigsberg. Very softly mumbled it on the last day. He said, it might indeed be possible that there are true propositions of the order of Goldbach's conjecture in Fermat's Last Theorem to very important unsolved problems. And in that day, Fermat's Last Theorem has now been proved. So like in the wild. But that there might very well be that for every formal system, there are true propositions of that order that can't be proved. It kind of mumbled it. That was the announcement of this incredible discovery. And nobody paid him any mind at all. And in fact, when the proceedings of that conference was written up in Herkentness, an organ of logical positivism published in Berlin, it wasn't even mentioned. Nobody even mentioned this. But there was a great mathematician, John Fann Neumann, who was there at that conference. He was standing in for David Hilbert. He was presenting Hilbert's formalism. And he came over to this young, shy mathematician afterwards and he said, wait a minute, did you just say what I thought you said? And he spoke to get enough so that our students He thought there's really something here. He went back to Princeton. He was at the Institute for Advanced Study, started to think some more, wrote to Goethe and said, it seems to be that if a consequence of your first theorem is that you can't prove the consistency of arithmetic, and Goethe wrote back and said, oh yes, you've got it right. I have the very formal proof here, a very rigorous proof here. And it was von Neumann who spoke up in completeness, theorem to everybody. And he was the one who disseminated it. Gregory, you also have an incompleteness theorem. Can you tell us from the horse's mouth what it's all about? Sure, Paul. You know, 80 years later, we still don't know what the hell Gertl proved. The problem, you see, the normal idea is mathematics gives absolute certainty. It's pure thought. If there's any place that there's certainly, it's in the world of pure thought. And in 1931, Gettle pulls the rug out from under that. So what the hell is mathematics? And it's 80 years, and we're still arguing. So the fallout has not stopped. The earthquake is still, there are still tremors. Now my own efforts understand what's going on. I've been using ideas that you refer to in your introduction of complexity, ideas that come from biology in a way, inspired by biology, but I've been using them in mathematical logic. And so with a notion of complexity or information content, I can show that the world of pure mathematics has infinite complexity or contains an infinite amount of information. But any mathematical theory only has a finite amount of complexity. So that makes incompleteness seem natural. Another way to look at it is I have a number called omega, which comes from Turing's halting problem. But it's sort of like the DNA for pure mathematics. And this number is a concrete example showing a place in pure mathematics where there's infinite irreducible complexity. The omega number, if you write it in binary, each bit is a complete surprise. It looks completely accidental. And this is a very concrete example showing that pure mathematics contains infinite irreducible complexity. So these mathematical facts, it seemed to happen for no reason. And it's an infinite number of them. So what I'm starting to think now is that what you can't predict. I mean, you can't predict what's coming next. You can't predict what's coming next. You can't prove what's coming next. It looks like God is tossing a coin in mathematical truth. Now, as a Platonist, I think each bit is determined. Nobody is playing dice with mathematical truth. But to us, it looks that way with any of the mathematical tools that we will ever have. So this is a place in pure mathematics where things look accidental, where they really escape beyond our powers. Now, what I'm beginning to think is that this is opening a door to biology. I'm beginning to think that what G\u00f6tel and Turing in 1936 came up with was the first step in the direction. This is Alan Turing. Alan Turing, 1936. Right. But what the door was opening, taking pure mathematics in a new direction, which I feel is the direction of biology, actually. I think history may say this in 50 or 100 years. Because you see, if you look at the omega number, what it shows is that pure mathematics contains infinite irreducible complexity. Now, normally, people think that the field of science where there's complexity is biology. Biology is the domain of the complex. There are no simple laws, right? But mathematics and physics are supposed to be simple governed by beautiful, simple equations. So what Gettle and Turing opened the door to is the fact that in fact pure mathematics has infinite complexity, and in a way is even worse than biology, because biology has very large complexity, but it's only finite. So pure math is even worse. And based on this hint, I've been trying to study the fundamental ideas of biology in an effort to come up with a theoretical biology, which is very hard, in fact, impossible. So I'm trying to do a theoretical meta-biology, which is instead of trying to have a theoretical mathematics for real biology, which is just too messy and complicated. It's hopeless. I'm trying to see if you can come up with a mathematical toy model that captures some of the essential ideas of biology. And it's a software model. And the basic idea is very simple. I'll summarize it in two phrases. Well, you said it. DNA is digital software. That's the basic idea. So I'm running with that idea as a mathematician. And the two phrases that define this metabiological effort that I think is promising, but is just beginning, is to look at biology with, through the evolution of mutating software, is one of the key phrases in metabiology. And the other key phrase is, is random walks in software space. So I'm going to just wave this mysterious words in front of you and say, come back in 50 years and maybe there'll be a field of mathematics there. Well, I might come back in 15 minutes about it. We'll see how much progress we've made in that time. But both of you mentioned the Platonists. And I think it might be interesting to get a sense of realism and non-realism in mathematics. Would somebody like to pick up on that, explain what it is? Well, I'm happy to talk about Platonism versus formalism that she mentioned and so on and what are these things. So Plato is Alfred North Whitehead once wrote that all of Western philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato. And so he was a very smart person. But maybe it's best what he thought is maybe best explained by his allegory of the cave. He said that we humans are like prisoners in a cave. Somebody is throwing shadows on the wall of the cave. The prisoners are forced to see the shadows. And that's what they think reality is about. So Plato basically said, mathematics exists in some world out there. This is a platonic world of mathematical forms. So when I draw a circle on a piece of paper, that's not the real circle. The real circle is in that world of mathematics. This is just a crude approximation for this circle. Most working mathematicians are Platonists in their hearts. Namely, they think that mathematics has this existence out there, and we're merely discovering the truth of mathematics. The school that Rebecca described before of the formalists, she actually used this analogy of chess. Basically says, no, no. I write down some rules and or some set of axioms and I can derive all of mathematics from that. It's like I give you the rules of chess, we play chess. I change the rules, we play a different game. Basically, the idea is I write down one set of axioms, I get some form of mathematics, I change the axioms, I get another mathematics. And the best example of this was the Euclidean geometry that we all learn in school. It was based on a set of ten axioms. One of which say that if you have a line and a point outside the line, you can pass a single parallel line to that line. That was thought to be truth from God until the beginning of the 19th century, when three mathematicians independently showed that actually you can dispose of that axiom altogether and you can develop new mathematics, one that can be described on a surface curved like a saddle, one on a surface like a sphere, and so on, in which this axiom doesn't hold true at all. And those are equally good descriptions of space and everything. So basically, formalists say, write down the axioms, give me what there is. What Gerdl did was that he pulled the rug underneath this entire premise. Because basically, to summarize in one sentence what Rebecca said, he basically showed that no formal system, no system of axioms you're going to write, are going to ever capture all the truths of mathematics. This is a simple way of saying this. In physics, I'm a physicist, people here may have heard the term theory of everything. We strive to get this theory of everything in physics. What Guddler's theorem shows that there There is no theorem of everything in mathematics. Namely, you cannot write down some set of axioms, and from that derive all of mathematics. So these were the tensions between these particular groups. On top of that, there was this third group, which is that of the logices, which is people like Bertrand Russell, Gottlob Frege, and others say, no, no, no, no, no. It all actually comes out of logic. I can write down some axioms of logic. For example, I tell you, either the Butler killed the millionaire or his daughter killed him. And then I tell you, the daughter didn't kill him. Then you have to conclude that the Butler did it. And this conclusion is not dependent on how old is the Butler, what's the length of the nose of the daughter, or any such thing. So there are some axioms of logic. And Gottlob Frege said that he could prove all of arithmetic. And by that, I mean even 1 plus 1 equals 2 from some axioms of logic. And that looked extremely good. I mean, this was almost everybody was happy. Because the formalists said, OK, it's all a game, but maybe there is a mother of all games. The Claytonists said, oh, if it all comes from some axioms of logic, surely those are somewhere there in that world of mathematics, you know, and so on. So all of this looked very good, except that when Frager was ready to send his fat book to the print, Bertrand Russell sent him a paradox, which is a little bit like what is sometimes called the barber's paradox. You know, there is this barber who has this sign, I shave all and only the men of the village who don't shave themselves. And this all sounds perfectly logical because the men who shave themselves don't need the services of the barber. And the barber shaves everybody else until you stop and ask, OK, but who shaves the barber? And if the barber shaves himself, he's one of those men that shave themselves and therefore he doesn't shave himself. If the barber doesn't shave himself, then he's one of those that don't shave himself and then he has to shave himself. So the paradox that Russell sent to Frager was not quite this paradox, but it had a similar flavor to it and so it basically showed that our logical system can be followed. So there was this crisis, you mentioned shock, you know, in Gerdl's theorem and so on. There was a sense that the whole foundations of mathematics became rather shaky and this is what for me as a physicist makes the puzzle even bigger in the sense that still while these foundations were shaking of mathematics, mathematics became this extraordinarily powerful tool in explaining the universe around us. So how can you explain the whole universe with something that has such shaky tools? I spoke a little bit long but I hope you... Well I'm going to pick you up on that in a moment, at that very point. But does anybody else want to comment more on this realism, non-realism, Platonism business? I have a whole bunch of remarks about, but they're a little tangential because I'm going to talk a little bit about the limit of public understanding. Because all sorts of remarkable things are happening in science. And there are a few directions in which the public has been misinformed in a strange way. And the result has been some strange beliefs. So let me mention one. This is a little different, but you've all heard of the uncertainty principle and the mysteries of quantum mechanics And many philosophers who know a little physics have explained to the public that the world of Newton, in which things were determined and mechanical and predictable, was really a nice beginning in physics. But the real physics is very different, and things are uncertain. And there's a famous Heisenberg principle that you can't know the position and velocity of a particle both at the same time. But only the more certain you are of one, then the less certain you are of the others. And that's perfectly true. But the numbers are very strange, because these quantum effects, in most cases, are very small. So here's the joke. Suppose we take the world of Newton and talk about the kinds of things that Dr. Chaitin is interested in, evolution and genetics and so forth, and think of a little molecule of DNA. And as everybody knows, that's the code which determines a lot about how biology works. Well, if you take the world of Newton and look at the solar system, that's sort of like an atom. There's a big star and little planets going around it. And then we know from about 1900 that atoms are the same sort of thing as a nucleus and little electrons going around it. But the joke is that things like solar systems aren't stable. So in the world of Newton, for example, some of I think Sussman and Jack Wisdom at MIT some years ago showed that probably in the solar system that we live in, Jupiter is so large and has such a big gravitational field. And Pluto is so far away from other things that in a few billion years, probably Jupiter will throw Pluto out. So it's not clear how long the solar system lasts. It won't be such a big disaster. It's not the planet anymore. But on the other hand, if you think of a molecule of DNA at room temperature, that's stable for a billion years. And so this is why evolution is possible because of quantum mechanics, not in spite of it. So that's just one. In other words, the public has been told that in modern physics, things are much vaguer and uncertain. And it's exactly wrong. In the Newtonian world, you couldn't have the kinds of stable structures. Well, there are about five more. But here's another one. We all learn about evolution. And there are some people who say, well, how could random changes and the kinds of variations so that Chaitan talking about lead to anything so magnificent as people with all their intelligence and mathematics and philosophy. How could that have happened when we're just making random changes and selecting them? Well have you ever thought about it? There's a problem with evolution as it's explained with Darwinian evolution. I'm not saying it isn't true, it's absolutely true, but there is a a little trouble with it. Namely, the way evolution works is you make little changes in organism, generally raddom, although not always, and then some of them live and some of them die because the ones with the wrong kind of toes fall out of the trees and yet it, you know, all sorts of bad things happen. What does evolution remember? It remembers of the things that worked, but it forgets what killed all the others. There's no record of that. And so, when it comes to intelligence, it may be that you couldn't evolve a brain with Darwinian evolution alone. But I'm not being mysterious here. I'm just saying the answer is language, culture, society, maybe some chimpanzee-like creature gets a few words are a few symbols. And what do we tell our children? Well, if you look at the fairy tales, I think the first great psychologist really was Sigmund Freud, who had this idea that the mind is many parts and very complicated. And one of the things Freud talked about is early experiences having big effects. Well, look at the legends that populate all cultures. all the legends, like the three little pigs and so forth, are about mistakes you can make and they're usually fatal. And the answer is a human child would never survive without a culture because it wouldn't live long enough to learn all the fatal mistakes that are coming. I could go on, but what I'm saying is that when we talk about the limits of understanding, I think we need to know much more about how human understanding itself evolved and develops. My feeling is that we're just at, one is always making fun of ancient people and their foolish legends. I think we're just coming out of one of maybe 20 different levels of ignorance going into the next one. We're learning more and more every year. Well, one thing I always feel ignorant about, I must say, or find difficult, is what's called the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in explaining the world. I never quite know why that should be the case. Can somebody help me? Sure, yeah. So, the phrase, by the way, was coined by Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner, the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences. There is, by the a paper entitled the unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics in biology. But in the physical world. So what is meant by this unreasonable effectiveness? So let me give you just a couple of very quick examples. So there was this astronomer Johannes Kepler and he made observations 400 years ago and they were not very accurate. They were accurate for his time but not very accurate. They were about accurate to within about 4%. Yet from those relatively scanty observations, Sir Isaac Newton managed to write a mathematical law of gravity that already by the 1950s was shown to be accurate to better than one part in a million. In fact, in an experiment done in 2008, they showed that the law, inverse square law of Newton holds down to a distance of 56 microns. One micron is one million of a meter. These are distances that Newton could have had no idea his mathematical law should hold true. What is it that gives mathematics such powers? We have a theory of everything that's electric and magnetic. It's called quantum electrodynamics. In this theory, it's a highly mathematical theory. You know, electrons that move in atoms, they are like little magnets. You can use this theory to calculate the strength of this magnet. We can calculate the strength to parts per trillion. Everyone now knows what a trillion is. It's the size of our annual deficit. You calculate this magnet to parts per trillion. In 2006, this magnetic strength of the electron was measured to parts per trillion. And the two results agreed to within eight parts per But Mario, why are you surprised? The world is built out of mathematics. God is a mathematician. So this is the most natural thing. I wrote a book with this title, but with a question mark at the end. Because you're a physicist. So the question is, indeed, how come mathematics is as powerful as it is? In particular, there is this thing which I sometimes call the passive effectiveness, which is mathematicians sit down, you know, people like Marvin and like Gregory here, they sit down, and they develop branches of mathematics sometimes with absolutely no application whatsoever in mind. In fact, they are proud that there are no applications. And yet, sometimes decades, sometimes centuries later, those very precise branches of mathematics are found to be exactly what is needed to theory. This was the case with Einstein's general relativity. This was the case with group theory. So these things exactly provide this. How come? Why is mathematics as powerful as that? I guess. Mario then Marvin. I think I... You can do Marvin. Do you mind being interrupted? No, absolutely not. Well, I think I have one funny answer to that, which is that let's think what would happen if it weren't, if the world didn't obey simple principles. And the answer is, do you think the world exists? People argue a lot of religions are based on the idea that, well, here's the world. Somebody must have made it. Of course, then you have to ask the question not just how does the world work, but how did the creator work. But the real problem is that the word existence doesn't make any sense. It's all right to say this table exists, because that means this table is in the universe. It doesn't make any sense to say the universe exists. So my argument is, one, this is just a possible universe. And now let's consider all the possible universes. And suppose you had a universe in which energy weren't conserved, then all of a sudden things would blow up. And DNA wouldn't last a billion years at room temperature. And so if you take all of the things that physicists say, look at this amazing mathematical thing. It's accurate to one part in 10 to the 16th. Then you say, well, what would happen if it weren't? And if you look carefully, you'd see that, well, then everything would explode or everything would disappear. And in fact, the current theory is that once in a while, some little thing in fact does explode and that's a big bang and another possible universe. This is not to both. This is not to both. So in other words, maybe you don't have to answer this question because the answer is obvious. In worlds where there are no laws, there is no DNA and no philosophers to discuss it. So let me just say a few things about it. I only read half your book. And you read the right half. You read the right half. Let me just say a few words about this. Because I wrote about the multiverse and things like this. So let me just say a few things. So Marvin is absolutely right in the following statement that he makes. He talks about a world in which there are no laws of physics or the laws of physics are very, very different from what we know them and so on. It is certainly the case that if there were no laws of physics, we might not have existed here. And furthermore, we wouldn't be talking about describing those laws of physics by mathematics. I mean, the fact that our universe is symmetric in the sense that, for example, an atom here behaves the same as an atom 12 billion light years from here, this is what allows us to try to explain anything. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. Now, that, however, still does not answer the question, why is our mathematics so adequate for describing the laws that exist? And how come that mathematics that are built with absolutely no application in mind turn out to be very descriptive of physical phenomena? But the answer there is actually, it's complicated, But it is not that difficult to understand. It's a combination of many things. Mario, the world has to be built out of something. Why not out of mathematics? That's the most beautiful thing we have. What do you have against my reason for all of this? The world is built out of pure mathematics. It's the most beautiful, the most fundamental things that exist. It has the most beautiful structure. Obviously, God, or the great computer programmer who made this simulation we're in, would use that beautiful stuff. What else would you make the world out of? Marshmallows? So here's another possible explanation. And that is that our science, starting in the 17th century, what physics did was to isolate structure and how do we describe structure in the language of mathematics. And so our laws that we've been able to formulate so far have all been structural, therefore mathematical, but are not getting at everything so that there are certain problems. For example, my favorite being the hard problem of consciousness, that we have not yet been able to tackle. It's not just that we can tackle it. You might be disagreeing with me here. I guess. But we don't know how to tackle it because we're using this kind of our notion that we've gotten from physics of what a law is, which is an isolating structure that we can express mathematically, but isn't exhaust. It's an incompleteness. It's another incompleteness theorem. not exhausting the stuff of matter. And so that would be another explanation for why we see laws of physics are always mathematical. Those are the only ones we can get at. We have the tools to get at that. I'm giving up sharing. Let me try to weave together some of what the three of them say. So Rebecca now touched something that is really very important, which is one of the things is that these are the things that we have at our disposal, and Gregory touched about that too. So we try to use them the best we can, and not only that, we try to actually tailor the mathematics we use a little bit to the problem at hand. For example, if I were to put pebbles into this bottle, and I would put three pebbles, then four pebbles, then I would be using arithmetic to describe what happens. Three plus four equals seven. If, on the other hand, I pour water into this bottle, I pour three times water, then four times water, I wouldn't describe arithmetic to it. I wouldn't say there is seven water in this bottle. So we tailored the mathematics that we use a little bit to the type of physics we want to solve. Then we touched upon this thing that not everything can be described by mathematics. And Marvin here described the thing. Why not? Well, I'll tell you why. Let me tell you why. Gettle would not like the way you gentlemen are arguing. As Rebecca points out in her beautiful book, Gettle is a man from the Middle Ages. and he was against empirical science. He said pure mathematics is the only field which conserves medieval theology essentially, which conserves idealism and Platonism, and he didn't believe in empirical science. All truths should be a priori truth, necessary truth, right? Well, I think... Right? So you gentlemen have a very, how do you say, an attitude which is quite common now, an empirical attitude, the word God can't be mentioned, mathematical beauty can't be mentioned, But Ghetto belongs to the Middle Ages, and he would be very uncomfortable. So I'm trying to let me say something. Let me tell you what Ghetto might have responded to. But let me take the example that Marvin used. Yeah, but Ghetto lived a few tens of years ago. We have advanced since then. I'm talking about something that we know how to write equations for. I want to describe what every atom in the atmosphere is going to do. So it sounds simple, right? I know the equations. If I just have a big enough computer, I'll be able to calculate that. Guess what? Not true. And you know why? Because you will need as an input to that computer to put the position and the speed of each atom when you start the calculation. Now, quantum mechanics tells us that I cannot tell precisely the position and the speed of a single atom. let alone of all the atoms in the atmosphere, yet the system is chaotic, which means it is infinitely sensitive to initial conditions. You change the position of one atom by a little bit, and the final answer is completely different. So there are problems where quantum mechanics and chaotic systems tell us that we will never be able to calculate. But we are able to try to address fundamental problems in physics, and there I agree with Gregory completely. Mathematics is our most beautiful tool to do this. That's what I do for a living. I use mathematics to try to explain the universe. Well, I'd like to go back to this consciousness, because I think that's a very strange situation, because the word consciousness, it's an old word, And I think it's a social word. And if you look in my book, I have something like 26 different meanings for the same word. And the reason consciousness is considered a mystery is because the philosophers who talk about it don't recognize that they're using it as a trash basket for 26, or I forget the number actually, of different problems about psychology that they don't understand. If you look in early Freud, he's saying that consciousness is the collection of activities that result when there are conflicts between basic instincts and higher level constraints between what the individual wants and what a culture wants. Freud's model is very complicated. It doesn't just have a conscious. He does use the word and he has a pre-conscious and he has sensors and and facilitators that active the gates. But the mystery of consciousness that it's very popular nowadays people like Stephen Hornet and other philosophers make a big fuss about it. But as far as I can see they never look at that word and see that this is just all the mysteries that all the things about Higher level thinking that they don't understand giving a single word to it Of course makes it seem like a big question a very hard question But if you break it into 26 easy questions, which in chapter 4 of the emotion machine Then you've got a lot of things to work on and there's no general mystery at all as far as I can see. Well, here's how philosophers often describe it. For example, Tom Nagel and what is it like to be a bat? For something to be conscious means that there is something that it's like for that thing to be that thing. What do you mean something? There are facts of the matter. There are facts of the matter. So right now. Is there is something it's like or is there a lot of complicated stuff? A lot of something. So for right now, for example, I'm conscious. I'm not sure about anybody else, but I am. And you could describe me. And as a novelist, of course I do this all the time. I describe what is it like for that character to be in the world? What is the world like for that character? What does it feel like? So there are sensations, there are memories, there are emotions. So there are 36 things. What's the problem? So the thing is that could you in getting a description of that person in purely another way of putting all of these facts, and there are facts about one subjectivity? Your brain has 20,000 genes. Do you want it to be 10 words or 50? That's silly. But here's the question. The question is, in the description of a purely physical description as we have it now, right, a purely objective description, would you be able to get out of that, the description of all that it's like to be that person at that moment, or even any of them, any of them? Sure, if it has 30,000 equations, why not? It's just hard. From that equation, you could get out that right now, I am... What's right now have to do with it? Well, because consciousness is something that takes place in the way... It's not something. It's a word. It's an experience. It is, it is a fact of what it is like to be a living person. There's no yet. All right, let me how do I put this? How do I put it without? Yes, Seth and Marvin. Marvin, with all due respect, you can't solve a problem by declaring that it's meaningless. I know this is a popular tactic. I said it's 26 problems. I said it's 26 problems. No, it didn't say it's meaningless. What Marvin is saying is that when you say consciousness, you don't mean a single thing. There are lots of problems involved in what one tries to bury under the concept of consciousness. And if you actually try to address, please correct me if I'm paraphrasing you, not in the right way, If you actually try to address individual problems, which you will phrase correctly and pose correctly, you may or may not be able to find physical solutions to each one of those problems. Let me give one example. I might be wrong about this, but I was reading Galileo once a long time ago. And he had an expression. It was written a long time ago. Yeah. He had an expression vis-viva, or the life of motion, or whatever it means. And here's the story. He's talking about this thing, and it's 100 years before Newton. And he's got momentum, which is MV, and energy, which is MV squared, and he's using the same word. That's all I'm saying. The reason people are puzzled about consciousness is it's the difference between Galileo and Newton, and they should be using 26 words, but they stick to it and they say it, it, what's it like? There's no it. There's 26 things. That's the problem here. There are probably more than 26 would be my guess. There are trillion neurons. You know what we're talking about here. I mean, the fact that we're describing this in purely objective terms, in purely physical terms, material system and I'm not a, you know, I'm not a dualist. I think that in fact we are our brains and that our our consciousness is a function of our brains. You're using it all the time. I don't use the word. It's a function of our brains. How is that, where's the it? I don't, I don't tell you it. The consciousness is it. It's a brace basket. That, everything that is true of me is true of my physical body, I would say, except the relationships and the things, but everything that is intrinsically true of me, true of my physical body. So it's not, I'm not proposing Cartesian dualism here to separate things, but that if you were to describe, as we can describe it now, using biological, physical descriptions, everything about my physical body, physical body, we couldn't get out of that description other facts that are true of me. Most people would look at a Macintosh and say it's doing this. What he's saying is that what you say may be true that, okay, maybe we don't know now because we don't even know all the functions that we need to explain. Exactly, I agree. Our current size is not even wrong. Exactly. That's how we would say it. Exactly. There's complete agreement there. Right, but it's not as if we know that in principle, that's not possible. Exactly, exactly. Does it help us at all to think about the problems in building a machine that has consciousness? Just to think about what the issues are there, does that help us? That's why I wrote that chapter, because it seemed to me there are a lot of functions you want a mind to have. And when I started cataloging them and trying to get students to program them, I found that there were a whole lot of them and that the philosophers who talk about it and like Chalmers and the hard problem of consciousness, they are trying to do the opposite. They're saying, I talk about qualia. What is the quality of seeing red? Instead of seeing this as associations with blood and with painting and with a hundred different things, as though there's a redness, But we know that some women have two reds. There isn't any red. Some people have no red. And how do we know this about these women? Is it by the description of this volume? Because they have four kinds of cones, and when you measure the right thing. How do we know? But we ask them, and we're asking them, what is the quality of this experience, and how are these reds different? You always have to go to the subject. They're not novelists. You're a novelist. So when you describe quality, it takes a whole book. When a philosopher describes it, they just say, oh, there's a qualium. Well, if we were to do justice to conscious experience, it would always take at least a novel at every moment. Sure. Well, since we've all agreed on consciousness now. What about free will? Anything to say about free will? So, no takers, no takers. Wouldn't it be horrible if there were such a thing? Einstein would always quote Schopenhauer, right? He said, you can do what you like, but you can't like what you like. So, like that. And John Horton Conway, just last year, proved the theorem where basically he showed that if we have free willed, then so do electrons, more or less. So I mean, free will meaning things are not determined, that our actions are not determined, or our states are not determined, that sense of free will. Because philosophers often redefine free will so that it is compatible with determinism. It's known as compatibilism. And that in fact it demands determinism, free will demands determinism. If in fact our actions are caused, are determined by our own desires, which are themselves determined. But if it's caused by a desire, then it's free. And that's a useful notion of freedom. It also ties in with our notion of responsibility. So if I go in and hold up a bank because somebody has threatened to kill my children, if I don't, you could say that my action was not free, or maybe it was free, because I wanted my children to live. But in any case, I mean the action of trying to save my children, this was free. But holding up the bank was not free because it was not my desire to hold up the bank. And so I should not be held morally responsible for it. Basically we want a notion of freedom that will help us out with a notion of moral responsibility. So if you want to go from one large question to another. I think we should get the Templeton Foundation to have another festival for this. Well, anyway, I'm making my way towards God. We'll get there in the end of it. I think the nature of discussion indicates also the magnitude of G\u00f6del's achievement to return to a theme that Rebecca touched on. Because you see, all these are words. As a mathematician, I can fantasize that someone will prove a theorem that we have free will or that we don't, or that someone will prove a theorem that we have consciousness or we don't. But we're a long way from that. But Gertl proved a theorem with such deep philosophical consequences that said 80 years later, we're still discussing where does this leave mathematics? Where does this leave certainty? Where does this leave pure reason? So as a pure mathematician, I think that's splendid. And I would like us to do the same with other deep philosophical questions, except I have the clue how. But does it upset you as a mathematician? Yes, it does. I think that sets me. That it can't be done. That's why I'd like to see a theorem proving that Darwinian evolution works so that it doesn't, because it's so basic and there ought to be a nice little theorem showing that it works. Otherwise, we're not doing our job. It's really, it was only, I mean mathematicians usually prove theorems that only have to do with mathematics. It's very, it's not, it's not pure mathematics, you know, a rigorous, yeah. But look at ghetto. and Turing are really the only two that did this, that proved mathematical theorems that spill out into philosophy. Well, let's keep it up. We have a good example. Let's not stop there. So I'm not sure why Gregory is upset, to be honest. I'm not upset. The fact that, because the, Gerdel's incompleteness theorems showed us limitation of mathematics within mathematics. Gerdel's incompleteness theorems did not stop physicists from continuing to apply mathematics to explain the universe. In fact, just about- But did it make them feel uncomfortable? No, not at all. Not at all. So why is that? Why does it not make them feel uncomfortable? Well, it's because it demonstrated more the shortcomings of formal systems. Exactly. Not of mathematics. A lot of mathematics is a whole necessarily, of formal systems. It's like you may remember that it's supposedly what mathematics is according to the current fashion. And that's what he showed was wrong. You remember that. But then what is pure mathematics? And nobody knows. You remember that in school. It's not a formal system. But it's not a formal system. In school, you know, you cleave in the people who play actually, were crazy about proving everything with a straight edge and a compass. Anything you couldn't do with a straight edge and a compass was not considered right, you know, and so on. Until, you know, others came and said, wait a second, why do I need these chains on me? I can do things otherwise, you know, and so on. So in the formal system, let me go back to the barber that I mentioned before. So there is this paradox, right, about the barber. You're not bothered because you're a physicist. We mathematicians, some of us were bothered. Then we solve the problem the way people usually do. If you can't solve a problem, convince yourself that it's not important. Forget about it. But wait a second. I mean, Gettel solved the problem. But the problem that Gettel posed is still on the table. What is pure mathematics? Hilbert said pure mathematics is a formal electromagnetic system which I'm going to discover and that's it. And now we know exactly what it means. Something is true if I can prove it according to these rules. Gettel showed that won't work. You're right. So now where does that lead to pure mathematics? I'll tell you. The answer is nobody knows. I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll tell you where it, I'll Number one, I'm a theoretical physicist, which means I use mathematics every day. But here, listen, we know that we have a problem with the foundation of quantum mechanics. We have serious problems with the foundation of quantum mechanics. All these things about how does observer and observer determine the results and so on. The famous, if a tree falls in the middle of the forest, there is another version of it that I like better which is if a man talks in the middle of the forest and there is no woman around is he still wrong? So, yes! I knew you would say that. I knew you would say that. No, so we know that there is a problem with the foundation of quantum mechanics. There are actually serious problems with the foundation. has that stopped physics from going on? The answer is no. Have Gertl's theorems stopped mathematics from going on? The answer is no. It's not about technology, but who cares about technology? The fundamental conceptual issues of the foundations of quantum mechanics are really terrible. And if you think, if you're interested in thinking and understanding the world, this is a serious problem. Now if you're interested only in making transistors and making a billion dollars, you don't care. But if you want to understand how the world functions, it's important that problem. You're too practical. I don't make a transistor. Kettle was not a practical guy. Kettle was not interested in making money. I don't have the first notion of how to make a transistor. I try to understand what dark energy is. Or if we live in a multiverse. No. I mean, okay, you're forgiven. My point is that Gerdel's theorems, in spite of the fact that, you know, certainly they are of huge import, they have actually not stopped the progress of mathematics. And that's an interesting question. How come? That's an interesting question in itself, which I would like to understand better. Well, and Gertl answers that Gertl himself said. I mean that he was showing the limitations of formal systems to capture everything that we know mathematically. But he wasn't showing the limitations of mathematical knowledge. I mean, he was in his paper, what is Cantor's continuum hypothesis. He talks about this, and he says, what he's shown is that mathematical intuition can't be eliminated. And it can't be eliminated from formal systems. So the question comes back to the mystery of mathematical intuition, which is partly the mystery of the hard problem of consciousness. Well, yeah, I mean, Ghetto himself has some lovely philosophical essays arguing that his theorem does not limit the power of mathematicians to solve any problem. However, if you look at these papers, they are full of words. They look like philosophy papers. And therefore, they're open to discussion endlessly. The greatness of G\u00f6del's first paper is that it deals with a fundamental philosophical issue, and it settles it via a mathematical proof. G\u00f6del himself was not happy with these essays that he wrote at the end of his life. Some of them he never allowed to be published, because he never found any proofs. It was they were all plausible arguments. They were all words. And so what we need is, in my opinion, is to duplicate Gettle himself, I think, was trying to find a proof of some of these results. And he never allowed these papers to be published because they were just words. And he was looking for a mathematical proof. So I think that we still need to understand these questions better. Sure. But when you say that the first paper was so fantastic because he got a full philosophical. You said it. I got it from your book. Oh, OK. I agree with your book. All right, I was going to ask you, but what is that philosophical insight that comes out of the 1931 paper? Well, that mathematics doesn't give up so certainly because it's not a formal system. That's one way to put it. I don't think a girl would agree with that. I think that he would say that mathematics does give absolute certainty even though it's not a formal system. because 80 years later and we're still arguing over what Gertl did or didn't have to. Could I ask another question, if I, I think that Michael Atiyan may have said this, I can't remember, if I was a jellyfish at the bottom of the ocean, was that a... Yeah, I can repeat the story. Oh, repeat the story and then when you've done that, tell me that if you were a jellyfish, instead of the individual. Sometimes I feel I am. Would you have a different concept of physics? So here is, it's not physics really, the question is was our mathematics in some sense inevitable? So our mathematics started by the Babylonians and the Greeks and the Egyptians and it started in particular with two fields, arithmetic and geometry. And in arithmetic, the most basic concept you can think of are natural numbers. One, two, three, four, five, six. So you might have thought that there is no way that any kind of civilizations, wherever they are, they would have to come up with the natural numbers. And those are inevitable. So then comes the question, suppose that intelligence resided not in humans, but in some isolated jellyfish living at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. All that this jellyfish can feel is the temperature of the water, the pressure of the water, the motion of the water. Would this jellyfish have come up with the natural numbers? And it can't count. There's no fish for it to count. There is nothing to count. This is why I said isolated. No figures. No figures. Isolated. So it's not sure that it would have... would have come up with that system. What about pellets of food? What? Isn't it eating something? Yeah. So it's not like that. It may be just taking water and taking whatever goes with it. Well, Einstein has a remark on this that I feel is very deep. Einstein has an essay or two where he says, even the positive integers are not a priori. You think they're a necessary tool of thought, but they are actually a free creation of the human mind invented by us to organize our sense perceptions. And this is a quasi-empirical view of mathematics that we invent mathematics, and that even the most fundamental concepts in pure mathematics are inventions. And this is a view that Gertl discusses, because the two of them talked all the time, in those late essays. But the question, I call it a quasi empirical view following Lakatos of the foundation of your mathematics. So I was trying to go one step further, and you said it wasn't a question of physics, because the reason I was asking the question was, because mathematics to us can make so much sense of physics. If I was a jellyfish, would I create a different physics? Or a different mathematics. Because I would have a different mathematics. So the question is, for example, why you may ask, and that's a deep question. Why did the ancient Babylonians start with arithmetic and geometry? And I'll give you why I think. No, that's why they chose a particular number for their base. But the question is why at all to start with arithmetic and geometry? And I'll tell you what I think. This is a personal opinion. I think that this has a lot to do with our perception system. Our perception system, and Gregory just alluded to it, our perception system, We are very, very good at seeing the boundaries of things. I can see that this is the end of Rebecca, and then there is some background, and so on. We're very good at this. This had to do with the fact that we started counting things. We are very, very good at seeing straight lines and curves. We can tell that something is a circle and not an ellipse. Again, because of the way our perception system works. This is, I think, why we started with geometry. Maybe if we saw everything in the infrared, let's say, where all the lines would have been blurred, you know, and so on, maybe we would have come up with a different concept, because we could have started with a different concept. So this is where absolute truth has gone. It's completely gone nowadays, but Gettel believed in absolute truth. And I still think it's a good thing to think about, even if it's not fashionable, it may come back. You don't know? When you mean a good thing to think about, a good thing to take seriously or just a good thing to ponder upon. All of the above. I don't quite see the difference. So Marvin, for example, can tell you that we could have started mathematics with these things which we call cellular automata, which are like little computer programs. You start with a certain small set of rules. You put one white pebble, next to it you put the black pebble, you know, and so on. You can show that you can derive much of our mathematics and physics from such small computer programs. Well, there is a funny experiment that Danny Bobrow and I did once in the early days of computers. Namely, we wrote a program that listed all possible Turing machines, starting with the very simplest ones. And in the first 2,000 of them, most of them did nothing, and some of them did little circles like counting up to three and starting over, and a few of them counted up, started counting the integers. And in the first, I think, 50 or 100,000, none of the machines did anything interesting except the ones that counted. So in other words, arithmetic is among the simplest things that can happen. That's a beautiful experiment. You know, this raises an issue, which is the traditional play in this view is God is a mathematician, the world is built out of pure math. There is a more modern version of this, which Marvin was alluding to directly, which is that God is a computer programmer, the world is built out of software. software. That's sort of the current reincarnation of that older view. This doesn't seem to me so very interesting. That is that what had to be true of our cognitive faculties in order for us to discover mathematics? Or if our cognitive faculties were different, we could have discovered these structures as well. Or maybe, you know, if our cabinet faculties were so very different, mathematics couldn't be discovered. We would not be able to access it. Doesn't seem to me to address the question of all is does there exist something independent there to be discovered? Whether we can, you know, it's a lucky fluke that we evolved intelligences that could discover this. I mean, to me it's amazing that we know anything at all. That we, the products of blind processes of evolution know anything, can sit up here talking about girdles and completeness theorems or relativity theory or quantum mechanics. It seems to me extraordinary. So the fact that if we had different cognitive abilities, we wouldn't be able to access the few things that we do access, doesn't seem to me to get at the heart of the objectivity of what we're discovering. Well, probably most planets don't have time, because it took about half a billion years. When did life start? Fairly early. Life started very early. 3.7 billion years. OK. But planets like this, with the sun, we only have three more billion years before the sun goes nova. No, it doesn't go nova. It becomes a red giant. Yeah. And so it might be that most planets don't have mathematicians. It's too bad. Well, there's a pressing question. Let's say we get signals from some other star. So there are these intelligent jellyfish right on some other solar system. And obviously, we will want to communicate. But we don't have much in common with these intelligent jellyfish. So what can we talk about? Gettles theorem. Maybe Gettles theorem. maybe prime number, the prime number theory, maybe logic, maybe philosophy, or maybe nothing. You know, maybe we have nothing in common. We can just send them cartoons or so. Yeah, I have to just say one thing about you. Well, they would pick up our TV programs. Goodell had very little faith in our ability to be able to communicate with one another with words. And that's why he wanted to, although he had these deep philosophical convictions. He never breathed a word of them to these people who were discussing them. He wanted a proof, a proof was, and there is this one story I love so much of, he was coming back from a meeting of the Vienna Circle and he said to another mathematician, Minger, well, I think Minger said to him, tonight we, out Wittgenstein, all those Wittgensteinians, We kept completely silent because Wittgenstein ends his tractotis by saying, you know, about what we can't speak, we must be silent, you know, a lovely tautology. And Giddle responded back, he said, the more I think about language, the less I believe that we can talk about anything of interest to one another, that we can understand each other through language at all. I often have that feeling in talking. But hopefully we haven't shown that to be the case this evening. There's a whole film. It's called Lost in Translation. So I want to just come back to you. You asked the question, and Rebecca just touched on it. So are we discovering mathematics, or are we inventing them? And I'll give you, this is a personal opinion. And mathematicians discuss this to death. And Gregory will say I'm a physicist, but yes, OK. No, Plato says we remember mathematics. Remember menon? Yes. You don't discover it or invent it. So here is the thing. When you pose the question like this, was mathematics discovered or invented, I think you have already committed an error. And the error is that when you pose it like this, people immediately assume that the answer has to be that it is discovered or it is invented and that it cannot be something different. Now, the way I think about this is that actually mathematics is an intricate combination of inventions and discoveries. And let me just say very broadly, very broadly, we invent the concepts and then we discover the relations among the concepts. I'll give you a specific example. There is no square root of minus one. There is no number that is the square root of minus one. Okay? Humans at some point had to invent that concept. They invented the concept. Once they invented the concept, they discovered that there is all kinds of mathematics you can do with that, you know, and so on and this. So you invented the concept, then you discovered lots of things, prime numbers, which Gregory mentioned. He will disagree in a second. Can I just give you a perspective from the other side of the wall? There are lots of, we all have to survive in this competitive world, so you have to publish a lot. A lot of the math papers that are published, frankly, look invented, artificial. You know, they are giving answers to questions which really were better left un-posed, right? Yes. But when you find a piece of mathematics that is really basic, that is really fundamental, you, sometimes maybe it's an illusion, you get the feeling that there was a certain inevitability to it, that you're just discovering something that existed there in the political idea. I agree. That's your feeling. But most mathematics, I agree. It's like that. Now, it's not reached this exaltation level. Take even the prime numbers, which is something that is, of course, favorite of everybody's. The Indian mathematicians, Chinese mathematicians, never actually invented the concept of prime numbers. It does not mean they didn't know that prime numbers exist. But as a concept, they did not declare it as such. And when you look at their mathematics, it doesn't appear there because they did not invent the concept. Now, of course, everybody knew that there are prime numbers there. But the fact that Euclid proved that there is an infinite number of them wrote a mathematical proof and so on, they became a very, very fundamental part of mathematics. Now, Gregory is going to say, yeah, we discovered so many things there about them, you know, and so on, they feel like a discovery. Yes, most of them are a discovery. Once you decided that the concept is there. Right, we're nearly at the end. I think I want no more than one minute from each of you. One, no more than one minute from each of you on what you think is the major limit of our understanding starting with Gregory. The major limit of our understanding. What I do think is that we don't understand the ghetto in completeness yet. It's still a challenge to us. The major limit of understanding complexity perhaps. Some things are too complicated for us. It requires too much information to hold in the human mind. In biology, you start to stretch through each of those limits. And so I think complexity is a very important limit. Rebecca? We'll just want to begin. There are just any philosophical problem measures the limits of our understanding. I think my field philosophy is what it is, is all of the problems that we are smart enough to ask, some of us. And I mean, it's really the hard thing is to even understand what the problems are. Just smart enough to ask and not smart enough to answer. So just go to philosophy and you will find all of the limits of our understanding. I think that right now what I see as the most major limit to our understanding is the fact that we cannot quite know what is truly fundamental and what may be just accidental. Kepler thought that the number of planets in the solar system was a fundamental thing which he needed to explain from first principles. Today we know that's not the case. It may be that some of the things that we now perceive as fundamental are not really such, and they are accidental, perhaps in a multiverse, you know, that we happen to live in a universe that has such things and so on. I think that the fact that we don't know this distinction is a major limit to our understanding. Modern. Well, I have the slightly different answer which I would hope that Chaitin and Rebecca would agree with. Well Chaitin will. It seems to me that the most important discovery since Gertl was the discovery by Chaitin, Solomonov and Kolmogorov of a concept called algorithmic probability, which is the fundamental new theory of how to make predictions given a collection of experiences. And this is a beautiful theory. Everybody should learn it. But it's got one problem, which is that you can't actually calculate what this theory predicts because it's too hard and requires an infinite amount of work. However, it should be possible to make practical approximations to the Chaitin, Kolmogorov, Solomonov theory that will make better predictions than anything we have today. And everybody should learn all about that and spend the rest of their lives working on it. I think this evening we've learnt one thing at least, that there's very little limit to the understanding of our panelists. Thank you very much. you you", "transcript_length": 13338, "reference_summary": "In tonight's program, we delve into the complex relationship between human understanding and mathematics, particularly focusing on the philosophical implications of mathematical logic. As a cornerstone of scientific inquiry, mathematics has significantly advanced our comprehension of the physical and biological worlds over the past four centuries. However, the limits of this understanding raise critical questions. Philosophers have long debated the validity of induction and the reliability of our senses, but the evening's focus will center on the revelations of Kurt G\u00f6del, whose incompleteness theorems challenged the belief in the provable consistency of mathematics. G\u00f6del's work revealed that certain mathematical truths cannot be definitively proven as true or false, suggesting a more tenuous relationship between truth and mathematics than previously thought. This revelation has profound implications, not only for mathematics but also for fields like physics and biology, where complex systems often defy common sense. As we explore these themes, we will begin with a video on G\u00f6del's life and contributions, highlighting how his groundbreaking ideas reshaped the foundations of mathematics and philosophy, despite his personal struggles with mental health.", "channel": "World Science Festival"}

We'll start using the assumptions of classical physics. First, we'll describe the initial setup and then play the simulation. For simplicity, we'll assume a one-dimensional space, so the particle can only move horizontally along this line, either left or right. Here's our particle. It's starting at position zero and has an initial velocity of four units per second. Now we'll play the simulation. Since our particle floats in empty space, it maintains a constant velocity. Note that time is slowed down by a factor of two. We'll play all simulations this way. way. Here's how quantum physics describes the same thing. The particle is represented by a wave function, such as this one. It contains information both about the particle's position and its velocity, but it will take us a while to explain how to read it all. First, we'll explain how to read information about position. The wave function is rotating around the main axis and its distance from it varies. Here, for example, the distance is high. Here it is lower. And here, even lower still. The particle is more likely to be found at a position where the distance is high, so it's more likely to be found here. Less likely to be found here. And even less so here. To better see the varying distances, let's draw a circle that touches the wave. Its radius shows us the distance at a given point. We'll slide it along the main axis and wrap the function with the resulting surface. So we don't know exactly where the particle is, but we do know the probability distribution distribution of its position. The wave function evolves with time according to an equation called the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This particular wave shape evolves by gliding to the right. In fact, it's moving at four units per second, but we'll explain about velocity later. Let's watch it again. Note how the wave is gradually spreading. We'll explain this too later on. The particle is too small to be observed directly, but we have a measurement device. It can only detect the particle within this range. When we click this button, a one-second timer is activated. When the timer is up, the device makes a measurement and tells us if it detected the particle. It will say yes if the particle is anywhere within the measurement range. Now let's run a little experiment. The particle again starts at position zero and has a velocity of four units per second. Our device has just been activated and will make a measurement in one second. It's easy to see that by that time the particle will be inside the measurement range. So we predict the device will say yes. This is the determinism of classical physics. If we know the initial state, we can predict the results of measurements. And now back to quantum physics. We paused just before the measurement. Can we now predict the result? The wave function doesn't tell us if the particle is inside the range or not. This is the famous indeterminism of quantum physics. But we can calculate probabilities. The volume of this slice is 35% of the total volume of this shape. And the remainder is outside. These are the probabilities of the two possible outcomes. This experiment ended with a yes result. If we run it again, we may end up with a no. The measurement also changes the wave. If the result is yes, the part outside the range gets zeroed out. Otherwise, the part inside the range is zeroed out. This is called wave function collapse. We'll now run the simulation in full, before and after the measurement. We'll repeat it twice, once for each possible outcome, and then explain. The measurement made the wave function collapse. Afterwards, the function continues to evolve smoothly according to the Schrodinger equation. But since it's different now, it will evolve differently as well. Here are four wave functions. They all give us the same information about the particle's position. But they rotate differently. This one rotates clockwise. This one rotates clockwise faster. This one, counterclockwise. And the last one doesn't rotate at all. Let's see how they evolve with time. The rotations contain information about the particle's velocity, but it's not so easy to interpret. Here's how we make this information more readable. We use a mathematical operator called the Fourier transform. It decomposes the wave function into the frequencies that make it up, creating a new wave function. This new function gives us information about the particle's velocity, in the same way the original wave function gave us information about the particle's position. To be more accurate, it gives us information about momentum, but we'll explain about momentum only near the end of the video. For now, it will work fine as the velocity wave function. The peak of the wave is at four units, meaning the particle's most likely velocity is four units per second. But it's not the only velocity our particle can have. As before, we don't know its exact velocity, only the probability distribution. This explains the spreading phenomenon we saw before. We'll demonstrate this using an example from classical physics. Here's a cluster of 100 particles. We distributed them horizontally randomly according to the position wave function. We'll now assign them with random velocities according to the velocity wave function. So some of them are a little faster than 4 units per second, and some are a little slower. The center of the cluster moves at four units per second, and it is gradually spreading. But remember that our wave function represents just one particle, and that there's nothing quite like it in classical physics. The inverse operation of a Fourier transform is yet another Fourier transform, and we can in fact reconstruct the original wave function from the new one. So both functions contain all the information about the particle. We've already seen how adding curls to the position wave function changes velocity. It also works the other way around. Adding curls to the velocity wave function changes the particle's position. We'll now run our simulation again, this time showing both wave functions. When the position wave function collapses, the velocity wave function will snap as well, according to the Fourier transform. Given a wave function, we can calculate mean and standard deviation. The standard deviation measures how far the wave is spread out from the mean. In quantum physics, standard deviation is related to a concept called uncertainty. To see it better, let's draw four standard deviations side by side. When the standard deviation is low, we have pretty good knowledge where the particle is. So we say uncertainty is low. And when the standard deviation is high, the particle can be anywhere within a wide range. So we say uncertainty is high. Now here's the curious property of the Fourier transform. If one uncertainty is low, the other one must be high, and vice versa. They can't both be low. So if we know approximately where the particle is, we'll know little about its velocity and the other way around. We can formulate this rule more precisely. This rectangle represents the uncertainty we have about the particle. It can be proven mathematically that its area will always be at least 8 square units. The rule says the rectangle can't be any smaller, but it can be bigger. Running our simulation again, the position wave will start spreading. And here's some more insight into this spreading phenomenon. If initially the uncertainty in position is low, then uncertainty in velocity must be high. So now the position wave will spread very fast. And vice versa. Now uncertainty in velocity is low, and the spreading phenomenon will hardly be noticed. As mentioned before, the velocity wave function is really the momentum wave function. This is explained in the final part of this video. Momentum is the product of mass and velocity. Here are two particles. The lower one is four times more massive. So if we give them the same velocity, then the lower one's momentum will be four times greater. And here's another way to look at it. Velocity is momentum divided by mass. Now we gave the two particles the same momentum, so the more massive particle is four times slower. To tie it all up, let's discuss units of measurement. The simulation so far didn't assume any particular units, so we can choose anything we want. For the position wave function, let's choose centimeters so it will be close to the size actually shown on your screen. Applying the Fourier transform, we get the momentum wave function. To put the display on a reasonable scale, we divided the momentum by a factor called the reduced-plank constant, or h-bar. Here is its value using our units of choice. For the mass of the particle, we chose the same value as h-bar in kilograms. This is close to the mass of an electron, so the mass and h-bar cancel each other out, and we ended up with plane velocity in centimeters per second. Now let's increase the particle's mass. The two wave functions remain the same. The uncertainty principle is the same. But the same values of momentum now translate to much lower velocities. Let's shrink the upper part of the image to bring velocity back to scale. Now let's reduce the uncertainty in position. And increase the velocity back to 4 cm per second. We'll repeat the same steps again. Increase the mass. the image, reduce uncertainty in position, and increase velocity. We are now ready for our final simulation. It's quite accurate to say the particle starts at position zero and has an initial velocity of 4 centimeters per second. Spreading will be slow because of the low uncertainty in velocity. So one second from now, the position wave will be almost entirely within the measurement range. And, we can predict with near certainty, the device will say yes. For the same reason, the collapse will hardly be noticed.", "transcript_length": 1690, "reference_summary": "The video presents simulations of a small particle's behavior under classical and quantum physics. Initially, the particle is modeled using classical physics in a one-dimensional space, starting at position zero with a velocity of four units per second. In this scenario, the particle maintains a constant velocity, demonstrating determinism; its future position can be precisely predicted.\n\nTransitioning to quantum physics, the particle is represented by a wave function, which encodes information about its position and velocity. The wave function's varying distance from a central axis indicates the probability distribution of the particle's position, revealing that it is more likely to be found where the distance is greater. The wave function evolves over time according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, illustrating the particle's probabilistic nature.\n\nWhen a measurement is made, the outcome is uncertain until the measurement occurs, highlighting quantum indeterminism.

It's a question that goes back at least two and a half thousand years to the ancient Greeks, and it's a question that has been discussed in this room many, many times over the past 200 years, but it's an important question and I think it's important that we revisited. And the question is simply this, what are we made of? What are the fundamental building blocks of nature that you and me and everything else in the universe are constructed from? That's the story I'd like to tell you. So what I'd like to do is try and give you an overview of our current understanding. I'd also like to try and give you an overview of where we hope to go in the future, of what progress we can hope to make in the next few years and few decades. And we're going to cover quite a lot of ground in this talk. I should warn you now, not least because I'm going to discuss every single thing in the universe, quite literally. We're going to talk, amongst other things, about what's happening at the world's most powerful particle collider. This is a machine that's called the Large Hadron Collider, or the LHC for short. It'll come up a lot in this talk. and it's a machine which is based underground in a place called CERN, which is just outside Geneva. We'll also talk about experiments in the last few years that look backwards in time towards the Big Bang that give us some understanding about what was happening in the first few fractions of a second after time itself started to exist. And on top of all this, I also want to give you some idea about the theoretical abstract ideas and even a little bit idea about the mathematics that underlies our current understanding of the universe. Because I'm a theoretical physicist. What I do is study the equations, try to understand the equations that govern the world we live in, and so I just like to give you a flavour of what that's about. At some point, I should warn you now, at some point I'm even going to show you an equation. OK? You know, you can get sent on training courses for this kind of thing. There's a number one rule. The number one rule is never show them any equations. If you show them equations, you'll just terrify them. At some point in this lecture, you're all going to be terrified. So just prepare yourselves. OK. OK. You know, there's a traditional way to start talks like this. The traditional way is to be very cultured and talk about what democracies and Lucretias said two and a half thousand years ago and the ideas that the ancient Greeks had about atoms. But I don't want to start like this. We've made a lot of progress in two and a half thousand years and you know, there's just better places to to kick off a science talk So the first modern picture that we had of what the universe is made of everything we're made of is this So I hope this is familiar to most people here. This is the periodic table of of elements. It's one of the most iconic images in all of science. What we have here are 120-ish different elements. I should point out no less than 10 of which were discovered in this very building and which constitute, or at least in the 1800s, were thought to constitute everything that existed in nature. So it's certainly true that any material you get you can distill it down into its component parts and you'll find that all of those component parts are made of one of these 120 elements. So it's a great moment in science. It's really one of the triumphs of science. It's also, I should add, the reason that I stopped doing chemistry in school. Because if you're a chemist, this is basically as good as it gets. And if we're honest, it's kind of a mess. Everything in the universe is classified into things on the left that go, bang, if you put them in water, through to things on the right, which really, if we're honest, don't do very much at all. You kind of organize everything into this stupid shape. So there's a little bit like Australia. There's a big dip in the top. And then there's these two strips of elements that you have to put along the bottom because there's no room for them in the middle where they belong. You know, I don't know about you. If I was asked to come up with a fundamental classification of everything in the universe, this isn't what I would have gone for. Are there any chemists in the audience? I'm sorry for you. Okay, but you know, I'm not alone in this. It's not just me that thinks this is a silly way to organize nature. Nature itself thinks this is a silly way to organize nature. Of course, we know this isn't the fundamental... This isn't the end of the story. This isn't the fundamental building blocks. And the first person to realize there's something deeper than this was a Cambridge physicist called JJ Thompson. So at the end of the 1800s, JJ Thompson discovered a particle that was smaller than an atom that we now call the electron. In 1897, he announced this in this room, in fact, in this very lecture series, to a stunned audience, an audience that was so stunned that at least half of them didn't believe what he was saying. There was one very distinguished scientist who afterwards told JJ Thompson, he thought the whole thing was a hoax, that JJ Thompson had just been pulling their leg. But of course, it's not a hoax. This isn't the fundamental elements of nature. And within 15 years of JJ Thompson's discovery, his successor in Cambridge, a man called Ernest Rutherford, had figured out exactly what these atoms are made of. And this is the picture that Rutherford came up with. So we now know that each of these elements consists of a nucleus, which is tiny, the metaphor that Rutherford himself used was it's like a fly in the center of the cathedral. And then orbiting this nucleus in, I should add, fairly blurry orbits are the electrons, which sort of fill out very sparsely the rest of the space. So that's a picture of these atoms. Subsequently, we learned that the nucleus is not itself fundamental. The nucleus contains smaller particles. They're particles that we call protons and neutrons. And in the 1970s, we learned that the protons and neutrons aren't fundamental either. So in the 1970s, we learned that inside each proton and neutron are three smaller particles that we call quarks. There are two different kinds of quarks. By the 1970s, I'm guessing physicists didn't have a classical Greek education, and they'd kind of run out of classy names. So we call these quarks the up quark and the down quark. Okay? For no good reason. It's not like the up quark is higher than the down quark. It's not like it points up. And just no good reason at all. The up quark and the down quark. So the proton consists of two up quarks and a down quark, and the neutron consists of two down quarks and an up quark. Okay? This, as far as we know, are the fundamental building blocks of nature. We've never discovered anything smaller than the electron, and we've never discovered anything smaller than the quarks. So we have three particles of which everything we know is made. And it's worth stressing. That's kind of astonishing. You know, we sort of take it for granted. We learn this in school, we don't really think about it deeply. everything we see in the world, all the diversity in the natural world, you, me, everything around us. We just the same three particles with slightly different rearrangements repeated over and over and over again. It's an amazing lesson to draw about how the world is put together. So that's what we have. We have an electron and two quarks. And these aren't the fundamental building blocks that the Greeks had thought about, and they're certainly not the fundamental building blocks that the Victorians had thought about. But the spirit of the issue really hasn't changed. The spirit is exactly what a democracy said 2,500 years ago. It's that there are like LEGO bricks from which everything in the world is constructed. These LEGO bricks are particles, and the particles are the electron and two quarks. It's a very nice picture. It's a very comforting picture. It's the picture we teach kids at school. It's the picture we even teach our students in undergraduate university. And there's a problem with it. The problem is it's a lie. It's a white lie. It's a white lie that we tell our children because we don't want to expose them to the difficult and horrible truth too early on. It makes it easier to learn, if you believe, that these particles are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. But it's simply not true. The best theories that we have of physics do not have underlying them the quark particle and the two quark particles, sorry, the electron particle and the two quark particles. In fact, the very best theories we have of physics don't rely on particles at all. The best theories we have tell us that the fundamental building blocks of nature are not particles, but something much more nebulous and abstract. The fundamental building blocks of nature are fluid-like substances which are spread throughout the entire universe and ripple in strange and interesting ways. That's the fundamental reality in which we live. These fluid-like substances we have a name for, We call them fields. So this is a picture of a field. This isn't the kind of field that physicists have in mind. This is what you think a field is if you're a farmer or if you're a normal person. If you're a physicist, you have a very different picture in your mind when you think about fields. And I'll tell you the general definition of a field. And then we'll go through some examples so that you get familiar with this. The physicist's definition of a field is the following. It's something that, as I said, is spread everywhere throughout the universe. It's something that takes a particular value at every point in space. And what's more, that value can change in time. So the picture to having your mind is a field, sorry, is a fluid, which ripples and sways throughout the universe. Now, it's not a new idea. It's not an idea that we've just come up with. It's an idea which dates back almost 200 years. And like so many other things in science, it's an idea which originated in this very room. Because as I'm sure many of you are aware, this is the home of Michael Faraday. And Michael Faraday initiated this lecture series in 1825. He gave over 100 of these Friday evening discourses. And the vast majority of these were on his own discoveries on the experiments he did on electricity and magnetism. So he did many, many things in electricity and magnetism over many decades. And in doing so, he built up an intuition for how an electric and magnetic phenomena work. And the intuition is what we now call the electric and magnetic field. So what he envisaged was that threaded everywhere throughout space with these invisible objects called the electric and magnetic fields. Now, we learn this in school. Again, it's something that we sort of take for granted because we learn at an early age and we don't sort of appreciate just how big of a radical step this idea of Faraday's is. I want to stress it's one of the most revolutionary abstract ideas in the history of science, that these electric and magnetic fields exist. So let me just, you're supposed to do demonstrations in this. And I'm not just a theoretical physicist. I'm a very theoretical physicist. It's very hard for me to do any kind of experiment that's going to work. But I'm just going to show you something that you've all seen. They're magnets. And we all played these games when we were kids or when we were in school. You take these magnets, and you move them together. And as they get closer and closer, There's this force that you can sort of just feel building up that pushes, the pressure that pushes against these two magnets. And you know, it doesn't matter how often you do it, it doesn't matter how many degrees you have in physics, it's just a little bit magical. You know, are you... And you all know this. There's something just special about this weird feeling that you get between magnets. And this was Faraday's genius. It was to appreciate that even though you can't see anything in between, even though no matter how closely you look, the space between these magnets will seem to be empty, he said nonetheless there's something real there. There's something real and physical which is invisible but is building up and that's what's responsible for the force. So he called them lines of force, we now call it the magnetic field. So on the, so this of course is a picture of Michael Farrell. This is a picture of Michael Faraday lecturing behind this very table. Here is a drawing from one of Michael Faraday's papers. It was pointed out to me earlier. When you leave, there's a carpet just here. The carpet has this pattern. This picture just repeated on it over and over and over again. And on the bottom here is one of Michael Faraday's most famous demonstrations that he did here. So I'll just walk you through what Faraday did. The thing on the right, there's a small coil with a hand on it. This is a battery, and the battery passes a current around this coil. And in doing so, there's a magnetic field that's induced in this. It's what's called a solenoid. And then Faraday did the following thing. He simply moved this small coil, A, through this big coil B, like this. And something miraculous happened. When you do that, there's a moving magnetic field. Faraday's great discovery was induction. It gives rise to a current in B, which then over on this end of the table makes a needle flicker, like this. So extremely simple. You move a magnetic field, and it gives rise to a current, which makes a needle flip flicker on the other side of the table. This astounded audience is in the 1800s, okay? Because you were doing something and affecting the needle on the other end of the table, yet you never touched the needle. You know, it was amazing. You could make something move without ever going near it, without ever touching it. We kind of jaded these days. You can do the same experiment. You can pick out your cell phone, you can press a few buttons. You can call somebody on the other end of the earth within seconds. But it's the same principle, but this was the first time it was demonstrated that the field is real. You can communicate using the field. You can affect things far away, using the field without ever touching it. So this is Michael Faraday's legacy. It's that there's not just particles in the world, there's other objects that are slightly more subtle, that are called fields, that are spread throughout all of space. But, by the way, if you ever want to really appreciate the genius of Michael Faraday, He gave this lecture in 1846, he gave many lectures in 1846, but there was one in particular where he finished 20 minutes early. He ran out of things to say. So he engaged in some idle speculation for 20 minutes. And Faraday suggested that these invisible electric and magnetic fields that he'd postulated were quite literally the only thing we've ever seen. He suggested that it's ripples of the electric and magnetic field, which is what we call light. So it took, of course, 50 years for people like Maxwell and Hertz to confirm that this is indeed what light is made of, but it was Faraday's genius that appreciated this, that there are waves in the electric magnetic field and those waves are the light that we see around us. OK, so this is Faraday's legacy. But it turns out this idea of fields was much more important than Faraday had realized. And it took over 150 years for us to appreciate the importance of these fields. So what happened in these 150 years was that there was a small revolution in science. In the 1920s, we realized that the world is very, very different from the common sense ideas that Newton and Galileo had handed down to us centuries before. So in the 1920s, people like Heisenberg and Schrodinger realized that on the smallest scales, on the microscopic scales, the world is much more mysterious and counter-intuitive than we ever really imagined it could be. This, of course, is the theory that we now know as quantum mechanics. So there's a lot I could say about quantum mechanics. Let me tell you one of the punch lines of quantum mechanics. One of the punch lines is that energy isn't continuous. Energy in the world is always parceled up into some little discrete lump. That's actually what the word quantum means. Quantum means discrete or lumpy. So the real fun starts when you try and take the ideas of quantum mechanics, which say that things should be discrete and you try to combine them with Faraday's ideas of fields which are very much continuous smooth objects which are waving and oscillating in space. So the idea of trying to combine these two theories together is what we call quantum field theory. And here's the implication of quantum field theory. The first implication is what happens for the electric and magnetic field. So Faraday-Tortis and Maxwell later that waves of the electromagnetic field are what we call light. But when you apply quantum mechanics to this, you find that these light waves aren't quite as smooth and continuous as they appeared. So if you look closely at light waves, you'll find that they're made of particles. They're little particles of light and these are particles that we call the photon. The magic of this idea is that that same principle applies to every single other particle in the universe. So there is spread everywhere throughout this room, something that we call the electron field. It's like a fluid that fills this room and in fact fills the entire universe. And the ripples of this electron fluid, the ripples of the waves of this fluid get tied into little bundles of energy by the rules of quantum mechanics and those bundles of energy are what we call the particle, the electron. All the electrons that are in your body are not fundamental. All the electrons that exist in your body are waves of the same underlying field. We're all connected to each other. It's like the waves on the ocean all belong to the same underlying ocean. The electrons in your body are the ripples of the same field as the electrons in my body. There's more than this. There's also in this room two quark fields and the ripples of these two quark fields give rise to what we call the up quark and the down quark and the same history for every other kind of particle in the universe. There are fields that underlie everything and what we think of as particles aren't really particles at all, they're waves of these fields tied up into little bundles of energy. So this is the legacy of Faraday. This is where Faraday's vision of fields has taken us. There are no particles in the world. The basic fundamental building blocks of our universe are these fluid-like substances that we call fields. All right. OK. So what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you where that vision takes us. I want to tell you about what it means that we're not made of particles, we're made of fields. And I want to tell you what we can do with that and how we can best understand the universe around us. So here's the first thing. Take a box and take every single thing that exists out of that box. Take all the particles out the box, all the atoms out the box. What you're left with is a pure vacuum, and this is what the vacuum looks like. So what you're looking at here is a computer simulation using our best theory of physics. It's something called the Standard Model, which I'll introduce later. But it's a computer simulation of absolutely nothing. Okay? This is empty space, literally empty space with nothing in it. This is the simplest thing you could possibly imagine in the universe. And you can see it's an interesting place to be, empty space. It's not dull and boring. What you're looking at here is that even when the particles are taken out, the field still exists. The field is there, but what's more, the field is governed by the rules of quantum mechanics. And there's a principle in quantum mechanics, which is called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which says you're not allowed to sit still. and the field has to obey this. So even when there's nothing else there, the field is constantly bubbling and fluctuating in what's quite honestly a very complicated way. These are things that we call quantum vacuum fluctuations. But this is what nothingness looks like from the perspective of our current theories of physics. It's worth saying that this is a computer simulation. It looks a little bit like a cartoon, but it's actually quite a powerful computer simulation that it took a long time to do. But these aren't just theoretical. These quantum fluctuations that are there in the pure vacuum are things that we can measure. There's something called the casimir force. The casimir force is a force between two metal plates that get pushed together basically because there's more of this stuff on the outside than on the inside. And these are real. These are things that we can measure and they behave just as we would predict they would from our theories. So this is nothing. And this brings me to the more mathematical side of the talk, because there's a challenge in this. This is the simplest thing we can imagine in the entire universe, and it's complicated. It's astonishingly complicated. And it doesn't get easier than this. If you want to now understand not nothing but a single particle, Well, that's much more complicated than this. And if you want to understand 10 to the 23 particles all doing something interesting, that's really, really much more complicated than this. So there's a problem in... My problem, not yours, in addressing this fundamental description of the universe, which is that it's just hard. Okay, the mathematics that we use to describe quantum fields, to describe everything that we're made of in terms of quantum fields, is substantially more difficult than the maths that arises in any other area of physics or science. It's genuinely difficult. I can put this in some perspective. There's a list of six open problems in mathematics. They're considered to be the six hardest problems in mathematics. There used to be seven, but some crazy Russian guy solved one of them. So there's six left. You win a million bucks if you can solve any one of these problems. If you know a little bit of mathematics, they're things like the Riemann hypothesis or P versus NP, and they're famously difficult problems. This is one of those six problems. You win a million dollars if you can understand this. So what does it mean? It doesn't mean can you build a big computer and just demonstrate that these are there. It means can you understand from first principles by solving the equations, the patterns that emerge within these quantum fluctuations. It's an extraordinarily difficult problem. It's right in the kind of thing I do. I don't know a single person in the world who's actually working on this problem. That's how hard it is. We don't really even know how to begin to start understanding these kind of ideas in quantum field theory. Okay. This theme about the mathematics being challenging is something which is going to come back later in the talk. So I'd like just to take a little bit of a diversion for a few minutes and give you a sense about what we can do mathematically and what we can't do mathematically. Just sort of tell you what the state of play is in terms of understanding these theories called quantum field theories, which underlie our universe. So there are times where we understand extremely well what's going on with quantum fields. and that happens basically when these fluctuations are very calm and tame, when they're not wild and strong, these ones are big but when they're much more calmer, when the vacuum is much more like a mill pond than it is like a raging storm, in those cases, we really think we understand what we're doing. To illustrate this, I just want to give you this example. So this number G is a particular property of the electron particle. I'll quickly explain what it is. The electron is a particle and it turns out the electron spins. It orbits rather like the Earth orbits. It has an axis of spin and you can change the axis of that spin. The way you change it is you take a magnetic field like this and in the presence of magnetic field, the electron will spin, the electron will stay in one place but spin and then the axis of spin will slowly rotate like this. It's what's called procession and the speed at which the axis of that spin processes is dictated by this number here. Okay, so it's not the most important thing in you know the big picture, however historically this has been extremely important in the history of physics because it turns out this is a number you can measure very, very accurately doing experiments. And so this number has sort of acted as a testing ground for us to see how well we understand the theories that underlie nature, and in particular quantum field theory. So let me tell you what you're looking at here. The first number is the result of many, many decades of painstaking experiments measuring very, very precisely this feature of the electron. It's called the magnetic moment, for what it's worth. And the second number is the result of many, many decades of very torturous calculations sitting down with a pen and paper and trying to predict from first principles from quantum field theory what the magnetic moment of the electron should be. And you can see it's simply spectacular. And there's nothing like this anywhere else in science with an agreement between the theoretical calculation and the experimental measurements. It's sort of, I think, it's 12 or 13 significant figures. It's really astonishing. Any other area of science, you'll be jumping up and down for joy if you get the first two numbers right. Economics, not even that. You know, just... But this is where we're at in particle physics. On a good day, when we really understand what we're doing, it's substantially better than any other area of science. 12 significant figures. But this, of course, I've shown it because this is our best result. There are many other results that are nowhere near as good. And the difficulty comes when those quantum vacuum fluctuations start getting wilder and stronger. So let me give you an example. It should be possible for us to sit down and calculate, from first principles, the mass of the proton. We have the equations. Everything should be there. we just need to work hard and figure out what the mass of the proton is just by doing calculations. We've been trying to do this for about 40 years now. We can get it to within an accuracy of something like 3%, which isn't bad. You know, we're 3% there, but we should be much, much better. We should be sort of pushing these levels of accuracy. And the reason is very simple. We've got the right equation. We're pretty sure we're solving the right equation. It's simply that we're not smart enough to solve it. 40 years, the world's most powerful computers, lots and lots of smart people. But we haven't managed to figure this out yet. There are other situations that I won't tell you about where we don't even get off the ground. There are some situations where, for fairly subtle reasons, we're unable to use computers to help us. and we simply have no idea what we're doing. So it's a slightly strange situation. We have this theories of physics, that the best theories we've ever developed, as you can see by this, but at the same time, they're also the theories that we understand the least. To make progress, we have this strange balancing act between increasing our theoretical understanding and figuring out how to apply that to the experiments that we're doing. And again, it's a theme I'll come back to at the end of this lecture. All right, so so far I've been talking in a little bit of generality about what we're made of. And this is the punchline for the halfway point of the talk. You're all made of quantum fields, and I don't understand them. At least I don't understand them as well as I think I should. So what I want to do now is go into a little bit more specifics. I want to tell you exactly what quantum fields you're all made of. In fact, I'll tell you exactly what quantum fields exist in the universe, and the good news is there's not many of them. So I'll simply tell you all of them. So we started with the periodic table. This is the new periodic table, and it's much simpler. It's much nicer. There are the three particles that we're all made of. There's the electron and the two quarks, the up quark and the down quark. And as I've stressed, the particles aren't fundamental. What's really fundamental is the field that underlies them. And then it turns out there's a fourth particle that I've not discussed so far. It's called the neutrino. It's not important in what we're made of, but it does play another important role in elsewhere in the universe. These neutrinos are everywhere. You've never noticed them. But since I began this talk, something like 10 to the 14 of them have streamed through the body of each and every one of you, as many coming from above from outer space as actually coming from below because they stream all the way through the earth and then keep going. They're not very sociable, they don't interact. So this is what everything is made of. These are the four particles that form the bedrock of our universe, except then something rather strange happened. For a reason that we do not understand at all, nature has chosen to take these four particles and reproduce them twice over. So this is actually the list of all the fields that make up particles in our universe. So what are we looking at here? This is the electron. It turns out there are two other particles which behave in every way exactly the same as the electron, except they're heavier. We call them the muon, which has a mass of something like 200 times the electron, and the tau particle, which is 3,000 times heavier than the electron. Why are they there? We have no idea at all. It's one of the mysteries of the universe. There's also two more neutrinos. So there are three neutrinos in total. And the two quarks that we first knew about are now joined by four others that we call the strange quark and the charmed quark. And then by the time we got here, we really ran out of any kind of inspiration for naming them. We called them the bottom quark and the top quark. So I should stress, we understand things very, very well going this way. We understand why they come in a group of four. We understand why they have the properties that they do. We don't understand it at all going this way. We don't know why there's three of these rather than two of them or 17 of them or that's a mystery. But this is everything. This is everything in the universe. Everything you're made of is these three at the top there, and it's only when you go to more exotic situations like particle colliders that we need the others on the bottom. But every single thing we've ever seen can be made out of these 12 particles, 12 fields. These 12 fields interact with each other, and they interact through four different forces. Two of these are extremely familiar, the force of gravity and the force of electromagnetism. But there's also two other forces which operate only on small scales of a nucleus. So there's something called the strong nuclear force which holds the quarks together inside protons and neutrons. And there's something called the weak nuclear force which is responsible for radioactive decay and among other things for making the sunshine. Okay? Again, each of these forces is associated to a field. So Faraday taught us about the electromagnetic field, but there's a field associated to this, which is called the gluon field, and a field associated to this, which is called the W and Z-Bows on field. There's also a field associated to gravity. And this was really Einstein's great insight into the world. The field associated to gravity turns out to be space and time itself. So if you've never heard that before, that was the world's shortest introduction to general relativity. And I'm not going to say anything else about it. I'll just let you figure that one out for yourself. Okay, so this is the universe we live in. There are 12 fields that give matter, I'll call them matter fields, and four other fields that are the forces. And the world we live in is these combination of the 16 fields all interacting together in interesting ways. So this is what you should think of the universe as like. It's filled with these fields, fluid-like substances. 12 matter four forces. One of the matter fields starts to oscillate and ripple. Say the electron field starts to wave up and down because there's electrons there. That will kick off one of the other fields. It'll kick off, say, the electromagnetic field, which in turn will also oscillate and ripple. There'll be light, which is emitted. So that'll oscillate and ripple. At some point, it'll start interacting with the quark field, which in turn will oscillate and ripple. And the picture we end up with is this harmonious dance between all these fields, interlocking each other, swaying, moving this way and that way. That's the picture that we have of the fundamental laws of physics. We have a theory which underlies all this. It is to put it simply, the pinnacle of science. It's the greatest theory we've ever come up with. We've given it the most astonishingly rubbish name you've ever heard of. We call it the standard model. Okay? When you hear the name, the standard model, it sounds tedious and Monday. It should really be replaced for the greatest theory in the history of human civilization. Okay? That's what we're looking at. Okay. So this is everything except it's not quite. I've actually just missed out one field. There's one extra thing we know about, which became quite famous in recent years. It was a field that was first suggested in the 1960s by a Scottish physicist called Peter Higgs. And it was, by the 1970s, it had become an integral part of the way we thought about the universe. But for the longest time, we didn't have direct experimental evidence that this existed, where direct experimental evidence means we make this Higgs field ripple so we see a particle that's associated to it. And this changed. This changed famously four years ago at the LHC. These are the two experiments at the LHC that discovered it. They're sort of the size of cathedrals and just packed full of electronics. They're astonishing things. This is called ATLAS. This is called CMS. The Higgs particle doesn't last for long. The Higgs particle lasts about 10 to the minus 22 seconds. So it's not like you see it and you get to take a picture of it and put it on Instagram. It's a little more subtle. So this is the data, and this little bump here is how we know that this Higgs particle existed. This is a picture of Peter Higgs being found. So this was the final building block. You know, it was important. It was a really big deal, and it was important for two reasons. The first is that this is what's responsible for what we call mass in the universe. So the properties of all the particles, things like electric charge and mass, are really a statement about how their fields interact with other fields. So the property that we call electric charge of an electron is a statement about how the electron field interacts with the electromagnetic field. And the property of its mass is the statement about how it interacts with the Higgs field. So understanding this was really needed so that we understand the meaning of mass in the universe. So it was a big deal. The other reason that it was a big deal is this was the final piece of Adjixor. We had this theory that we called the standard model. We've had it since the 1970s. This was the final thing that we needed to discover to be sure that this theory is correct. And the astonishing thing is this particle was predicted in the 1960s. 50 years we've been waiting. We finally created it in CERN. It behaves in exactly the way that we thought it would. absolutely perfectly behaves as we predicted using these theories. Okay, this is going to be the scary part of the talk. I've been telling you about this theory and I've been waving my hands, pretending that I'm a field. Let me tell you what the theory really is. Let me just show you what we do. This is the equation for the standard model of physics. standard model of physics. I don't expect you to understand it, not least because there are parts of this equation that no one on the planet understands. But nonetheless, I want to show it to you for the following reason. This equation correctly predicts the result of every single experiment we've ever done in science. Everything is contained in this equation. This is really the pinnacle of the reductionist approach to science. It's all in here. So, you know, I'll admit, it's not the simplest equation in the world, but it's not the most complicated either. You can put it on a T-shirt if you want to. In fact, if you go to CERN, you can buy a T-shirt with this equation on it. Let me just give you a sense of what we're looking at. The first term here was written down by Albert Einstein and describes gravity. What that means is that if you could solve this tiny little part of the equation, just this, excuse me, just this R, you can, for example, predict how fast an apple falls from a tree, or the fact that the orbits of the planet around the sun form ellipses. Or you can predict what happens when two enormous black holes collide into each other and form a new black hole, sending out gravitational waves across the universe. Or in fact, you can predict how the entire universe itself expands. All of this comes from solving this little part of the equation. The next term in the equation was written down by James Clark Maxwell, and it tells you everything about electromagnetism. So all the experiments that Faraday spent a lifetime doing in this building. In fact, all the experiments over many centuries, from Coulomb to Faraday to Hertz to modern developments of lasers, everything in this tiny little part of the equation. So there's some power in these equations. This is the equation that governs the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force. This is an equation that was first written down by a British physicist called Paul Dirac. It describes the matter, describes those 12 particles that make up the matter. Astonishingly, each of them obeys exactly the same equation. These are the equations of Peter Higgs, and this is an equation that tells you how the matter interacts with the Higgs particle. So everything is in here. It's really an astonishing achievement. This is our current limit of knowledge. We've never done an experiment that cannot be explained by this equation, and we've never found a way in which this equation stops working. So this is the best thing that we currently have. Okay. It's the best thing that we currently have. However, we want to do better. Because we know for sure that there's stuff out there that is not explained by this. And the reason we know is that although this explains every single experiment we've ever done here on Earth, if we look out into the sky, there's extra stuff which is still a mystery. So if we look out into space, there are, for example, invisible particles out there. In fact, there's many more invisible particles than there are visible particles. We call them dark matter. We can't see them, obviously, because they're invisible. But we can see their effects. We can see their effects on the way galaxies rotate or the way they bend light around galaxies. They're out there. We don't know what they are. There's even more mysterious things. There's something called dark energy, which is spread throughout all of space. It's also some kind of field, although not one we understand that's causing everything in the universe to repel everything else. Other things, we know that early in the first few seconds, earlier than that, the first few fractions of a second, After the Big Bang, the universe underwent a very rapid phase of expansion that we call inflation. We know it happened, but it's not explained by that equation that I just showed you. So these are the kind of things that we're going to have to understand if we're going to move forward and decide what the next laws of physics are that go beyond the standard model. I could spend hours talking about either of any of these. I'm going to focus just on the last one. I'm going to tell you a little bit about inflation. So the universe is 13.8 billion years old. And we understand fairly well, well, we don't understand at all how it started. We don't understand what kicked it all off at time t equals 0. But we understand fairly well what happened after it started. And we know in particular that for the first 380,000 years of the universe, it was filled with a fireball. And we know this for sure because we've seen the fireball. In fact, we've seen it and we've taken a photograph of it. This is called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. But a much better name for it is the fireball that filled the universe when it was much younger. The fireball cooled down. Its light has been streaming through the universe for 13.8 billion years. But we can see it. we can take this photograph of it and we can sort of understand very well what was happening in these first few moments of the universe. And you can see it looks literally like a fireball. There's red bits that are hotter, there's blue bits that are colder. And by studying this flickering that you can see in this picture, we get a lot of information about what was going on back 13.8 billion years ago when the universe was a baby. One of the main questions we want to ask is what caused the flickering in the fireball? We have an answer to this, which I think is one of the most astonishing things in all of science. It turns out that although the universe lasted for 380,000 years, whatever caused this flickering could not have taken place during the vast majority of that time. course the flickering in this fireball actually took place in the first few very fractions of a second after the Big Bang. And what it was was the following. So when the universe was very, very young, there was this, when the universe was very, very young, soon after the Big Bang, there were no particles, but there were quantum fields, because the quantum fields were everywhere. And there were these quantum vacuum fluctuations. And what happened was the universe expanded very, very quickly, and it caught these quantum fluctuations in the act. So the quantum fluctuations were stretched across the entire sky, where they became frozen, and it's these vacuum fluctuations here, which are the ripples that you see in the fireball. So it's an astonishing story. The quantum vacuum fluctuations were taking place 10 to the minus 30 seconds after the Big Bang. They were absolutely microscopic. And now we see them stretched across the entire universe, stretched 20 billion light years across the sky. That's what you're seeing here. And yet you do the calculations for this and it matches perfectly what you see here. So this is another of the great triumphs of quantum field theory. But it leaves lots of questions. The most important one is, which field are we seeing here? Which field is this that's imprinted on the background radiation? And the answer is we don't know. The only one of the standard model fields, it has a hope of being is the Higgs. But most of us think it's not the Higgs, but probably something new. But what we'd like to do moving forward into the future is get a much better picture of this fireball, in particular, get the polarization of the light. And by getting a picture of this, we can understand much better the properties of this field that was fluctuating in the early universe. OK, this, looking forward, is one of the best hopes that we have for going beyond the standard model and understanding new physics. In the last 10 minutes, though, I'd like to bring you back down to Earth. Sort of. We've got lots of experiments here on Earth where we're also trying to do better, where we're also trying to go beyond the standard model of physics, beyond that equation, to understand what's new. And there's many of them, but the most prominent is the one I've already mentioned. It's the LHC. So what happened was the LHC discovered the Higgs boson in 2012. And soon afterwards, it closed down for two years. It had an upgrade. And last year, in 2015, the LHC turned on again with twice the energy that it had when it discovered the Higgs. And the goal was two-fold. The goal was, firstly, to understand the Higgs better, which is done fantastically. And secondly, to discover new physics that lies beyond the Higgs, new physics beyond the standard model. So before I tell you what it's seen, let me tell you some of the ideas we had, some of our expectations and hopes for what would happen moving forward. So this is our favorite equation again. The idea has always been the following. If you're a Victorian scientist and you go back and you look at the periodic table of elements, then it's true that there's patterns in there that give a hint of the structure that lies underneath. There's numbers that repeat themselves. If you're very smart, you might start to realize that, Yes, there is something deeper than just these elements. So our hope as theorists is to look at this equation and see if maybe we can just find patterns in this equation that suggest there might be something deeper that lies underneath. And they're there. So let me give you an example. This is the equation that describes the force of electricity and magnetism. And it's almost the same as the equations which describe the forces for the strong force and the weak nuclear force. In fact, you can see I've just changed letters. It's a little more complicated than that, but it's not much more complicated than that. The three forces really look similar. So you might wonder, well, maybe there's not three forces in the universe. Maybe those three forces are actually just one force, and when we think there's three forces, it's because we're looking at that one force just from slightly different perspectives. Maybe. Here's something else which is amazing. These are the equations for the 12 matter fields in the universe. The neutrinos, the electrons and the quarks. Each of them obeys exactly the same equation. Each of them obeys the Dirac equation. So again, you might wonder that, well, maybe there aren't 12 different fields. Maybe they're all the same field and the same particle. And the fact they look different is, again, maybe just because we're looking at them from slightly different perspectives. Maybe. So these ideas that I've been suggesting go by the name of unification. The idea that the three forces are actually combined into one is what's called grand unification and it's very easy. It's very easy to write down a mathematical theory in which all of these are just one force which which appears to be three from our perspective. There are other possibilities here. You might say, well, this is the matter and these are the forces and the equations are different, but they're not that different because ultimately they're both just fields. So you might wonder if maybe there's some way in which the matter and the forces are related to each other. Well, we have a theory for that as well. It's a theory that's called supersymmetry and it's a beautiful theory. It's very deep conceptually and it sort of, you know, smells like it might be right. Finally, you might be really, really bold. You might say, well, can I just combine the lot? Can I just get rid of all of these terms and just write down one single term from which everything else emerges, gravity, the forces, the particles, the Higgs, everything? Well, I've got something for you if you want that as well. It's called string theory. So we have a possibility for a theory which contains all of this in one simple concept. And the question going forward, of course, is, are these right? It's very easy for us theorists to have these ideas. And I should say these ideas of what's driven theoretical physics for 30 years, but we want to know are they right? And we've got a way of telling them, right? We do experiments. So I should say if you want to know if string theory is right, we don't have any way to test it at the moment. But if you want to know if some of these other ideas are right, then that's what the LHC should be doing. The reason that we built the LHC was firstly to find the Higgs, okay, it worked. And secondly, to test these kind of ideas that we've been having to see what lies beyond. So the LHC has been running, it's been running for two years, it's been running like an absolute dream, it's just a perfect machine. Two years, this is what it's seen. Absolutely nothing. All of these fantastic, beautiful ideas that we've had, none of them are showing up at all. The question going forward is, what are we going to do about it? How are we going to make progress in understanding the next layer of physics when the LHC isn't seeing anything and our ideas just don't appear to be the way that nature works? I should tell you off-and-on, I don't have a good answer to this. My impression is that most of my community is a little bit shell-shocked by what happened. There's certainly no consensus in the community to move forward. But I think there's three responses that various people have had that I'd like to share with you. I think all three of these responses are reasonable up to a point. The first response to the LAC not seeing anything is the following. It's, well, you young kids, you're so pessimistic. It's all doom and gloom with you. You need a little bit more patience. You didn't see anything last year, and it didn't see anything this year. But next year it's going to see something. And if not next year, it's the year after that that it's going to see something. It's usually my very illustrious senior colleagues that have this response. And you know what? They could easily be right. It could easily be that next year the LHC discovers something astonishing, and it sets us on the path to understanding the next layer of reality. But it's also true that these same people were predicting that it would have seen something by now. And it's also true that this can't keep going for much longer. If the LHC doesn't see something within, say, a two-year time scale, it seems very, very unlikely that it's going to see something moving forward. It's possible. It just seems unlikely. So we'll know, I hope, with all my heart that the LHC discovers something next year or the year after. But I think we have to prepare for the worst, that maybe it won't. OK, response number two. Response number two, which is also by similar people. Well, all our theories are so beautiful. They absolutely have to be correct. And what we really need is a bigger machine. 10 times bigger, we'll do it. OK, again, they might be right. I don't have a good argument against it. The obvious rebuttal, however, is that a new machine costs $10 billion. And there's not too many governments in the world have $10 billion to spare for us to explore these ideas. There's one. The one is China. And so if this machine is going to be built at all, it's going to be built by the Chinese government. I think the Chinese government would see it as extremely attractive if the whole community of particle physicists and engineers that are currently based in CERN and Geneva move to a town that's slightly north of Beijing. I think there'd view that as a political and economic gain. And there's a real chance that they may decide to build this machine. If they do, it's about 20 years for it to be built. So we're waiting slightly longer. There's a third response. I should say the third response is the camp I'm in. I should mention upfront, it's speculative and it's probably not endorsed by most of my peers. So this is really just my personal opinion at this point. This is my take on this. This is the equation that we know is right. This is sort of the bedrock of our understanding. But although we know it's right, there's an awful lot in this equation that we haven't understood. There's an awful lot to me that's still mysterious in this equation. So although this equation looked like there were suggestions of unification, maybe they're just red herrings. And maybe if we just work harder and try to understand this equation more, we'll find that there are other patterns that emerge. So my response is I think that maybe we should just go back to the drawing board and start to challenge some of the assumptions and paradigms that we've been holding for the past 30 years. So I should admit, I feel quite energised actually by the lack of results for the LHC. It feels good to me that everyone was wrong. It's when we're wrong that we start to make progress. So I feel quite happy about this and think that there's a very real chance that we could just start thinking about different ideas. I should say that there are hints in here. There are hints to me about mathematical patterns that we haven't explored. There's hints in this about connections to other areas of science, things like condensed metaphysics, which is the science of how materials work, or quantum information science, which is the attempt to build a quantum computer. All of these fantastic subjects have new ideas which sort of feed in to the kind of questions that we're asking here. So I'm quite optimistic that moving forward, we can make progress, maybe not the progress that we thought we'd make a few years ago, but just something new. So that's the punchline of my talk. The punchline is that this is the single greatest equation that we've ever written down. But I hope that someday we can give you something better. Thank you for your attention. There's nothing discreet about the Schrodinger equation. The Schrodinger equation is something, you know, to do with a smooth field like wave function. The discreteness is something which emerges when you solve the Schrodinger equation. So it's not built into the heart of nature.", "transcript_length": 9806, "reference_summary": "In tonight's discussion, we will explore one of science's fundamental questions: what are we made of?

From opening it, he has startled to found himself facing the imposing figure of Urbain Le Verrier, France's most famous astronomer and the director of the Imperial Observatory in Paris. Now, without so much as a how-do-you-do, Urbain Le Verrier forces his way into Les Garbots hallway demanding to inspect his astronomical equipment. You see, Les Garbots, as well as tending to the aches and pains of his local community, is a keen amateur astronomer, and a week or so earlier, he wrote a letter to Le Verrier telling him about a strange object that he saw crossing the face of the sun earlier that year. Now, this letter so incensed Laverier that despite it being New Year's Eve, he immediately jumped on a train and just a few hours later was hammering on poor old Lescarbo's front door. So what was all the fuss about? Well, Laverier had long been troubled by the orbit of the planet Mercury. Now, this image on the slide shows, hopefully this works, sorry, it's not turned on. What you see here is a transit of the planet Mercury across the face of the sun, as imaged by a NASA spacecraft. Now, Mercury had repeatedly embarrassed astronomers throughout the 19th century when they found that they missed its transit, sometimes by hours in one extreme case by an entire day. Now, in a universe that was supposed to run like clockwork according to Newton's law of gravity, a planet with such poor timekeeping was really very troubling indeed. Now, Leveret had recently solved a similar problem with the orbit of the planet Uranus by proposing the existence of an unseen eighth planet whose gravitational tug was subtly altering Uranus's orbit. And when astronomers pointed their telescopes at the point in the sky that Leveret told them, they discovered an eighth planet, Neptune. So Leveret thought, I can pull off the same trick twice, essentially, perhaps the weird orbit of Mercury is explained by another ninth planet, this time in between the orbit of Mercury and the Sun. And so when he read Les Garbeau's letter, he immediately thought, perhaps this rural doctor has actually discovered my hypothesized world. So hence, he now finds himself in Les Garbeau's hallway. So he submits his observatory to a sort of thorough investigation. He finds it relatively satisfactory. Then he submits Les Garbeau himself to an intense interrogation, the one account compared to the meeting of a lion and a lamb. And then to cop it all off, he goes around the village and demands character witnesses from Les Garbots' neighbors to check he's not being taken in by a confidence trickster. But by the end of the day, he returns to Paris, convinced that his new planet has indeed been found. On the 2nd of January, just a couple of days later, he announces to the world the discovery of a planet he calls Vulcan after the Roman god of fire. Now this causes an international sensation, headlines all over France and Great Britain about the discovery of a ninth planet of the solar system. And Lescarbeau finds himself catapulted from obscure rural doctor to being fated by the great and the good of the astronomical community, and he is awarded the Ligand d'Honneur for his discovery. Now, Le Verrier, based on Lescarbeau's observations, calculates the next time that Vulcan should transit the sun. But when astronomers look for it, they don't see it. And this continues throughout the 19th century. Over a course of decades, a thorough search is made for Vulcan. Occasionally, there are sporadic sightings, but no one manages to predictably identify where this planet actually is. And by the early years of the 20th century, astronomers are forced to accept that Le Verrier's hypothesized world Vulcan does not, in fact, exist. So what was going on? Well, there is still, nonetheless, a problem, an anomaly with the orbit of Mercury. So this is essentially what's happening. What you can see here in this little animation is a planet orbiting the sun. Now, Mercury, like all planets, orbits the sun in an ellipse. But this ellipse doesn't stay fixed in space. It actually processes. You can see that this ellipse is rotating. Now, this is due to the gravitational tug of other planets in the solar system. But when you predict the rate of this procession using Newton's law of gravity, you get the wrong answer. Mercury actually processes slightly faster than predicted. Now this is a tiny effect. Basically this means Mercury performs an extra orbit, one every 12 million Mercury in years. So we're talking about a one in 12 million anomaly. But nonetheless, it cannot be explained by Newton's law of gravity. Now it turns out this anomaly had a far more profound implication than the discovery of just another planet. It actually was a clue to a radical new picture of space, time, and gravity itself. The solution was eventually found by this man. So this, you'll recognize, hopefully, as Albert Einstein. But not as you're used to seeing him. This is him at the height of his powers in his 30s. And in 2015, he was putting the finishing touches to what would be his masterpiece, a theory, a radical new theory of space, time, and gravity that is known as general relativity. Now, as a first test of his new theory, Einstein attempted to calculate the procession of Mercury's orbit. And he found an answer that exactly matched the astronomical predictions. Now, Einstein was apparently so overwhelmed by this that he actually had heart palpitations and had to lie down. This was the culmination of seven years, essentially, of hard slog. And one of the nice things that Einstein said about this moment, he said, it gave me an appreciation for the fastidiousness and pedanticness of astronomers that I used to make fun of in the past. Essentially, what this little anomaly was, was a clue to one of the most profound realizations in modern physics. General relativity transformed their understanding of the universe. It led to the Big Bang theory. It led to black holes, gravitational waves, and many more besides. And that is all from one small anomaly. Now, essentially, the reason that this anomaly shows up is because Einstein did away, in some sense, with the force of gravity. He said there isn't really such a thing as gravity. What actually happens is a massive body like the sun warps the fabric of space time. So you kind of imagine the classic analogy is to imagine space time as a kind of elasticated sheet and a heavy body like the sun bends space-time around it. And this bending is most extreme closest to the sun. And as Mercury is the innermost planet, that's where the difference between Einstein's theory and Newton's theory is most apparent. So I tell you this story ready to illustrate the power of anomalies. Anomalies essentially are little deviations often from our expectation based on our current theories. And they can sometimes be the clue to profound insights about the world around us. And that's what this talk today is going to be about. It's also what my book, Space Oddities, is about. It's about anomalies, both past and present, that are challenging our understanding of the universe. I'm going to begin with a quote that's very close to my heart. So this is a quote from the American science fiction writer, Isaac Asimov, who says, the most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, isn't Eureka. I found it. But, hmm, that's funny. So I'm going to tell you about a bunch of, hmm, that's funny things that are going on in physics at the moment. But to begin, let me set the scene. So why do we actually think there are new things out there in fundamental physics to discover? We actually know a huge amount about the world. And we've discovered a huge amount in the last century since the story I just told you. And these are knowledge of the universe is encapsulated in two extremely successful theories that we rather boringly refer to as standard models. One is the standard model of particle physics. This diagram essentially represents the known elementary particles that make up the world around us, the forces that allow them to interact with each other. It's described by a very beautiful, elegant piece of mathematical theory. The standard model is one of the most successful theories in history. It explains everything from the structure of atoms to how the sun shines. On the other end of the scale, this is the theory of the very small. We also have a standard model of the very, very big. Now, we know from astronomy, from looking up into the universe, for example, looking at galaxies, that there is a large amount of invisible material out there in the universe. In the 1970s, astronomers discovered that stars orbit galaxies too fast for the amount of matter that we see to hold them gravitationally together. And this led to the realization that there's a large amount of stuff called dark matter, essentially some kind of invisible substance that provides extra gravity that holds galaxies together. And looking even further out to galaxies themselves, we see that the universe is expanding. And in the 1990s, it was discovered that this expansion is actually accelerating. And this led to the discovery of another dark thing known as dark energy, which is a kind of repulsive force that is causing the universe to get bigger and bigger at an ever-increasing rate. So this pie chart essentially represents what cosmology tells us the universe is made from. That 5% sliver you can see that's labeled atoms, that's us, that's the Earth, So that's everything we can see in the night sky, every star, every galaxy, every cloud of dust or speck of dust. Now that is what is described by the standard model of particle physics. So this tremendously successful theory of the micro world, which was really in some sense the closest we've come to a theory of everything, only describes 5% of what's out there. The rest of it, 27% dark matter, 68% dark energy, we have no idea what they are. And this is one of the primary reasons we believe there is more to discover in the universe. Now this description of the universe is encapsulated in a theory known as the Standard Cosmological Model, which essentially describes the history of the universe beginning with a very rapid period of expansion known as inflation, which gave rise to the Big Bang, and then the universe has been expanding ever since, with dark energy gradually accelerating that expansion later on in its history. So we have these two tremendously successful models, but in some sense they are in conflict with each other. The standard model of particle physics can't explain very much about what we actually see up there in the universe. So I'm going to tell you two stories tonight, about two anomalies. One that comes from the very, very small scale, the world of particles, and another that comes from the grandest scales, the scale of the universe as a whole. So I'm going to begin with a demonstration. So hopefully you all were handed a little half of a, what look like 3D glasses when you came in. So what I'm going to do, if we could lower the lights a bit please, what I've got here is a hydrogen lamp. So essentially there's a little container of hydrogen here and it's going to pass a high voltage electric current through. Now what first I want you to do is just, I can only turn this for a short while. So if you hold up the thing to your eye and look at the lamp, I'll give it a little rotate so you can see it. Hopefully, also for those watching on the live stream, you'll be able to see this because the cameraman is going to kindly hold up the diffraction grating to the camera. What hopefully you can see are two lines. You don't see it. Maybe it's pointing at you. Yeah, it's just coming around gradually. Can you see anything? People seeing something? Yeah? So what colors can you see? Fuchsia and red. Yeah, you're so. I'll just keep doing this a bit longer So you'll get a look. So what you're looking through is a diffraction grating. So what it's doing is breaking the light from the hydrogen lamp up into a rainbow spectrum. And what you see is actually, there are only really two prominent colors there. I'll turn that off. Thank you very much. If you didn't see it, that's what you should have seen. So what you are looking at there, you are seeing a quantum mechanical effect. You are seeing evidence with your own eyes of quantum mechanics. So what's actually going on? Well, you were looking here, as I said, in this container there is hydrogen. Hydrogen is the simplest atom. It's a single proton orbited by a single electron. Now, according to quantum mechanics, electrons can't orbit a proton at any distance, like planets can orbit the sun. They can only orbit in strict quantized energy levels at certain distances, essentially, from the nucleus. Now, normally, hydrogen, the electron, would be in the lowest energy states. You can see these various orbitals. The lowest one labeled N equals 1 is the one the electron would normally be in. But by passing this high, this electric voltage through the hydrogen, you excite the electron up into a higher orbital. And then what happens is it falls down back into the lower orbital. So see here we've got an electron going around in the third orbital. And if I press a magic button, it will then quantum jump down into the second orbital and emit a photon. So the photon that's emitted carries away the energy difference between those two levels. And that produces that red band that you can see. Another thing that can happen is the electron can be in the fourth energy level. And similarly, it can perform a quantum jump and fall down into the second energy level. And this time it gives off a sort of bluish photon of slightly higher energy. So that's what you're seeing. Those two lines you saw are essentially quantum jumps in a hydrogen atom. Now, there was a crucial anomaly that was discovered related to these very transitions back in 1947. And this discovery was carried out by a man called Willis Lam and his assistant, Rutherford. And essentially what they had done is they had spent their time micro-waving hydrogen atoms. And in the process, they had discovered that in this second orbital that we can see the electron moving around in, which is the one that these transitions were taking place to, it wasn't actually a single energy level, but two energy levels with very subtly different energies. In fact, the energy difference was tiny. It was about one part in a million. Now, that may not sound like a big deal, but when Lam went to this, this is a picture of a conference that took place in 1947 on Shelter Island near New York. And it was the first major conference where the sort of, the galacticos of the theoretical and experimental physics world got back together in the aftermath of the Second World War. Oppenheimer was there, for example. So what you can see here, Lam is the guy leaning over the table, and there's an interesting discussion going on in the middle is Richard Feynman and on the right is Julian Schwinger. And Lambs' one in a million anomaly was actually a crucial clue that allowed Feynman, Schwinger and various others to form what is now the basis of our understanding of the physical world. This was really the beginning of what we call quantum field theory. So quantum field theory says something rather strange, which is actually that particles like electrons and quarks aren't really, in a sense, fundamental. They're manifestations of much less tangible, more ethereal substances known as quantum fields. So you can think of a quantum field as kind of like an invisible fluid that permeates the entire universe. And in this picture, a particle like an electron is just a ripple, essentially a vibration in this invisible field that fills the whole universe. So that means that every electron and every atom in our bodies is just a little vibration in this universal electron field that is all around us. Now, we know of about 17 particles in the Standard Model of particle physics. That means there are 17 fields. Now, this has a rather profound implication for what we mean when we talk about space. What do we actually mean by empty space in this picture? Well, what you would think of as empty space, imagine going to some distant part of the universe, intergalactic space where there's very little stuff and you build a box and you suck every stray atom out, you're literally left with nothing. What does nothing look like in this picture? Well, it actually looks rather interesting. This is a picture of nothing, an animation of nothing. So what you're looking at here, this is from the University of Adelaide, is a simulation of vibrations, of subtle quantum vibrations in these quantum fields that are always there in the vacuum. So essentially, even when there are no particles there, because Because of quantum uncertainty, these fields are constantly shimmering, they're sort of jittering like a gentle breeze on the surface of a pond. You can see this incredible agitated quantum motion. And actually what Lam had seen, this subtle shift between these two energy levels in hydrogen, was actually the influence of empty space on the orbit of an electron as it moved around the atom. Essentially, one orbit got buffeted more than the other by these quantum fluctuations and led to a very small difference in energy. And it was this crucial clue, this tiny one in a million anomaly, that led to this profound new understanding of the micro world. And quantum field theory is now the language with which we describe all of modern particle physics. So this is a huge moment in the history of physics. But I'm going to come on to the actual anomaly that's troubling physicists today. So the fact that the vacuum has all these quantum fields in it provides us with an incredible tool for probing things that we haven't yet seen. So I'm going to show you how we can do this. So this is a particle called a muon. Well, it's not really. It's a picture I drew of one. But a muon you may not have heard of. It's essentially a heavy electron. So the muon is a partner of the electron. It's exactly the same as an electron, in fact, except it's 200 times heavier, and it doesn't live very long. Muons only live for about a millionth of a second, and then they decay. But there are actually muons in this room right now. They're produced by cosmic rays striking the upper atmosphere, and they fly through the Earth's atmosphere and down to the ground. So there are a few of them zipping through you at any one moment. Now, a muon like an electron is electrically charged, and it also has a property called spin. So this is essentially as if the muon is rotating on its axis. Now, thanks to Michael Faraday, we know that if you have a rotating electric charge, you also get a magnetic field. So faraday did experiments where he passed electric currents around loops, a magnetic field is produced, a muon rotating behaves a bit like a moving electric current, and you get a magnetic field. Now, why is the magnetic field of a muon interesting? Well, this is why. The muon doesn't actually just sit there on its own in the vacuum. It's actually surrounded by all of these quantum fluctuations, so these sort of vibrations that are happening in these 17 fields that I discussed earlier. And this means that when you measure the magnetism of a muon, you're not really just measuring the magnetism of a muon. You're measuring the magnetism of a muon plus all its interactions with the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum. And that means that if there are new quantum fields that we've not seen before, for example, if there is a quantum field that dark matter is a vibration in, that dark matter field is also there in a vacuum in the vacuum. and it can contribute to the magnetism of the muon. So if you make a very, very precise measurement of how magnetic muons are, and then you do a very precise theoretical prediction of all these quantum fluctuations based on what we already know, and you see a difference, that subtle difference can tell you about the existence of potentially, say, dark matter or some other new force that we've never seen before. So this is a tremendously interesting thing to do. And indeed, physicists have spent decades making ever more precise measurements of this tiny little bar magnet that the muon carries around with it. Now, about more than 20 years ago, an experiment was conducted, one of the sort of latest in the series of experiments measuring this property at Brookhaven in New York. They used this big magnetic ring that you can see behind me. Essentially, they fired muons around the ring, and as the muons went around the ring, they measured how magnetic they were. And this is what they found. So the experiment measured the magnetism of muon tremendously accurate. So this is a number, obviously. Don't worry too much about what it means. Well, the thing you should notice is it's quite a lot of decimal places, and this is the experimental measurement, and this was at the time the theoretical prediction. Now if you compare these two numbers, you see that they agree pretty well until you get to the last four or so digits. So you have this disagreement essentially in the last four digits. Now if you compare that, these measurements and the prediction actually come with what we call an uncertainty, which is an expression of how well we think we've measured the quantity or how well we've calculated it. So you can see the uncertainty, that is right at the end. There's certainties about six, three, and but the difference between these two is actually quite a lot larger than that. So I'm very pleased with this animation. So if you take these two things and you subtract them from each other, you get the difference between experiment and theory. That took a long time to do actually, the PowerPoint doesn't, anyway. And what they found when they did this calculation, that there was actually, the difference between theory and experiment was more than three times the combined uncertainty on the measurement and on the prediction. So this was potentially a clue to the existence of some new quantum field that we'd never seen before. So, in principle, tremendously exciting. So this is around 2006 or so. Unfortunately, when you get an anomaly like this, you can't really immediately conclude that you ought to book a flight to Stockholm to be awarded a Nobel Prize, because there often are boring explanations for what you're seeing that aren't the discovery of some new force of nature. So boring explanation number one is that you made a mistake in your experiment. And this does happen. Now physicists are very careful and they try their best to do the best experiments they can, but you can never eliminate the possibility that you've missed something. So that's one option. The second option is that the result is a fluke. In other words, because you have some uncertainty on your measurement, that value that you got could have landed anywhere, basically, in a band. And you may have just by dumb luck ended up, or bad luck, perhaps, ended up with a result that was quite a long way from the theoretical prediction. So it could just be a fluke. The last option is that the theorists forgot to carry a one. So what I mean by this is actually these calculations. Calculated magnetism is a thing to do. It's easy to make some incorrect assumption or in one case with this very prediction get a swap a plus for a minus that happened and led people to think they were discovering something when they weren't. All these three things can happen. You have to eliminate these three options before you can conclude that you're discovering something new. Unfortunately, by 2006, the old experiment in Brookhaven had shut down. It wasn't really going to be able to collect more data. So members of that original team got together and started planning a souped up version of this, what became known as the Muon G-2 experiment. This was going to be a brand new experiment built from scratch at Fermilab near Chicago. The only bit of the old experiment they were going to reuse was a superconducting ring that provided the magnetic field that the Muons go around inside. So essentially what they had to do was ship this giant ring from Brookhaven down the Atlantic seaboard of North America, around Florida through Hurricane Alley, and then up the Mississippi River on a barge, all the way essentially to suburban Chicago before it was put onto a big truck, and they closed the freeways and brought it into Fermilab. And here's a nice little video from Brookhaven. This is the ring being removed from Brookhaven. You can see it's a bit of an operation. It then gets loaded onto this flatbed truck and wrapped in white plastic to protect it. Now, there's a funny story about this, which is that there was a rumor, a sort of urban legend on Long Island, that in the 1960s, a UFO had crash landed. And it had been immediately whisked away behind the walls of Brookhaven Laboratory by the White Coats. And then, lo and behold, decades later, a thing that looks for all the world like a flying saucer emerges from the gates of the laboratory. Now, it didn't help that the moving company actually stuck a little green alien on what looks like the cockpit. Chris Polly, who was the spokesperson of the experiment when I interviewed him for the book, told me that they told local residents who set up deck chairs to watch this strange procession in the middle of the night. One guy came up to him and said, you can't tell me that's not a freaking spaceship. Anyway, it wasn't a spaceship, it was a magnet. It arrived at Fermilab, was installed, they completely rebuilt the experiment. This experiment is extraordinarily sophisticated. described as being like a 600 tonne Swiss watch. You have to measure the strength of your magnetic field incredibly accurately. The detectors were already built. The temperature and humidity control in the building down to the end of the degree. So a really impressive experiment. So this is how it works. So now Dan, I need you to come on and bring me a rope. This is not because the talk is going really badly, I hope. Thank you. So this is where it all goes wrong. So what I'm going to try and demonstrate to you is basically how the Mjoln G1 experiment works. So remember we said the Mjoln is spinning. And so to represent the Mjoln, I have this bicycle wheel. So what happens essentially is you have Mjolns that are fired into this magnetic ring and they are all polarized. So they're sort of spinning, they're spin axes in their direction of travel. So they're spinning in one direction. So if I spin up this bicycle, oh, hopefully this will work. And I let it go. This is what we call procession. So you can see that the wheel processes it rotates. Now, unfortunately, the rope's moving around a bit, which slightly hides the effect. But essentially, as the muons go around the ring, they do the same thing that this bicycle wheel is doing. And their axis of rotation processes in the magnetic field. You can see on the little diagram, this is going to hit me in the face, that they're shifting angle. And the rate at which they process tells you how strong the muon's little bar magnet is. recession rate, you measure the magnetism of the mule. So that is basically how the thing works, right? Thank you, Dan. I'll take the rope back for now, at least. Thank you. You're easily impressed. Thank you. So they took their data. They analyzed the first year of data. And in April 2021, they were ready to announce to the world the new measurement of the magnetism of the muon. And to everyone's delight, the new measurement landed bang on top of the old result from Brookhaven, which caused this to happen. So you've got press headlines around the world from the New York Times, tiny particles wobble, upends the known laws of physics. Bit of an exaggeration, but OK. The BBC did a bit better. Muon's strong evidence found for a new force of nature. So essentially, by measuring this property, again, with a different experiment, mostly a completely different team, they had pretty much eliminated two of the boring explanations. It seemed very unlikely now that this was just a mistake in the experiment, because you have two independent experiments that get the same answer. Also, because you now have two measurements with similar uncertainties, when you combine them, they're combined uncertainties to get smaller, and that makes the probability that it's a random fluke really ruch much lower. In fact, there was only now around in 140,000 chance that this anomaly could just be explained by dumb luck. So there is one explanation that we still haven't eliminated, and this is where it gets a bit murky. So here is a little diagram that illustrates the situation when the result was announced. So you have your theoretical prediction that is somewhat lower than your experimental measurement. You can see based on the uncertainties, these two points are quite a long way apart. Now there's always a twist when you just think things are going well, which is on the very same day, the Muon G-2 experiment published their new measurement. A rival team of theorists produced, published a new theoretical prediction of the Muon's magnetism, and their result landed much closer to the experiment. So, if you believe one theory, it's a gold-plated anomaly, it looks like you're really seeing something fundamentally new that could be a clue to something very exciting. If you believe the other group of theorists, there's There's nothing to see here, Gov, basically. So, now you may be wondering how two different groups of theorists can get two different answers, and it's not just because one of them forgot to carry a one. Okay, it's much more complicated. Basically, calculating the magnetism of a muon is a very, very difficult thing to do. You have to take into account all these quantum fluctuations from 17 different quantum fields that we know about in the standard model. And in particular, there are a bunch of fields that are very hard to calculate. These are the fields that produce, essentially the nuclear material in the atom. So these are particles known as quarks and gluons. Now, for technical reasons that I won't go into, and also once I didn't really understand that well, quarks and gluons, the theory of quarks and gluons is very, very hard to make tractable calculations in. So you have to make approximations in order to get out the contribution of the quark and gluons fields. And these two theoretical groups use different approaches. One uses a sort of data-driven approach and the other uses a first principle approach using a big supercomputer, essentially. So the situation we're now in is that we do not know if this anomaly really is the clue to something big, and it could be massive. So one potential explanation for this anomaly is that the muon is being affected by what we call dark forces. So this is not something out of Harry Potter. It's actually, so we know that universe is dominated by dark matter, and in principle it's possible that just like the ordinary matter universe has its set of forces, electromagnetism and the nuclear forces, dark matter may also have its own set of forces through which it interacts. And one explanation for this anomaly among many is that dark forces are affecting the magnetism of the muon. Or it could be that we don't understand the physics of quarks and gluons properly. So to settle this story, theorists are really gonna have to slug it out and come up with a consensus prediction before the muon's magnetism. So this is a classic story of how anomalies work. Sometimes they can lead to a massive breakthrough in your understanding. But even when they don't, they often improve your understanding of the current science. So even if at the end of all of this massive effort that everyone's gone to to measure this tiny magnet, we find that there is no new physics. We will have learned a huge amount, not only in terms of experimental techniques, but also in terms of the physics of fundamental ingredients of our universe that we do know about. So it's never wasted effort, although of course we'd all hope that it's something exciting. So I'm now going to switch to the other end of the scale and tell you a second story. This time, an anomaly that has been occupying the field of cosmology for the best part of a decade now. Now to tell this story, I'm going to take you back in time to just after, essentially, Einstein has come up with his theory of general relativity. So back in the 1920s, there was a big debate in astronomy about the size of the universe. There were these objects that were seen in the night sky, a time known as spiral nebulae, these whirlpool-shaped smudges. And there was a disagreement over whether these swirly, cloud-like things were just clouds of dust and gas inside the Milky Way, or perhaps galaxies in their own right outside of the Milky Way itself. So at the time, the view was that the universe was one galaxy. So one island of stars amidst this endless blackness. To figure this out, you had to find a way of measuring the distances to these spiral nebulae. And this is something that the American astronomer Edwin Hubble spent a lot of time using the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson in an attempt to unravel. Now, the problem with measuring distances in astronomy can be encapsulated by this lovely scene from Father Ted, where Ted attempts to explain to his half-witted fellow a priest doogle, the differences between a small cow that is close and a big cow that is far away. Now, I'm not saying astronomers are as dumb as doogles, but they have the same problem, essentially. I've got a nice video that the RI demo team, Dan, prepared, which essentially is two lamps which were shone down the hallway. Actually, I know I've got this wrong. How is it all there? Sorry. It skipped a slide. Apologies. Hopefully, This will work? Is it going to play? No, it doesn't want to play. Let's try this. Okay, so these are two lamps. Now they are of different brightnesses and of different distances, but I think you would struggle to tell which one's further away until the lights come on when you reveal that one of them is actually the end of the RI corridor, the other one is much closer. So they have the same problem that you don't know whether a star is big and bright but far away or small and dim but close. And the person who allowed us to figure out essentially how far away stuff is in the universe, at least stuff beyond our local galactic neighborhood. Is this woman, this is Henrietta Swan Levitt. She was a pioneering astronomer of the late 19th, early 20th century. And she spent much of her time studying a type of star known as a cepheid. So cephides are young bright stars that have these pulsating atmospheres. So they grow and shrink over time. And you can see hopefully in this animation, this star is pulsating. And so they get brighter and dimmer as you watch them through a telescope. Now Levitt discovered that there was a relationship between how fast this star pulsed, essentially the heart rate of this star, and how bright it was. So stars that pulsed more slowly were brighter, stars that pulsed more quickly were dimmer. And if you could calibrate this, this allowed you to measure distances because you could look at a sephiod in a distant galaxy, you could measure its pulse period very easily because you just count, essentially, you time it over a period of days or weeks, and then you know from its pulse period how bright it is, and if you know how bright it is, you know how far away it is, from how bright it appears in your telescope. So you suddenly now have a ladder, essentially a distance ladder, that allows you to measure distances. When Hubble did this, he found sephiids in Andromeda, which is the largest spiral nebulae in the night sky, and he found that Andromeda was a million light years away, far larger than the established size of the galaxy at the time. This proved that there were galaxies outside the Milky Way. The Hubble spent the following years having massively expanded the size of the universe, making similar measurements to a whole host of galaxies outside the Milky Way. He discovered this extraordinary relationship, which was that there was a relationship between how far away a galaxy is and how fast it's moving away from us. It was observed by Vesto Sleefa that almost every galaxy in the night sky is retreating from us. He figured this out essentially by looking at the light from those galaxies. Because they're moving away, their light is what we call redshift, that it's stretched to longer wavelengths. This is the same effect you get when an ambulance goes past you in the street and its siren goes from high pitch to low pitch. The same thing happens with light. You measure speed from this stretching of the light and you measure distance using Henrietta Swan-Levitt's Sephia. When you do this and you plot it on a graph, you find that a further away a galaxy is, the faster it's moving away from us. Essentially, what Hubble had found was that the universe is expanding. Now, I'm going to try and demonstrate this. This could go horribly wrong. So it's quite hard to imagine a three-dimensional space. So what's actually happening here is that the space between the galaxies themselves is getting bigger. Now, this is quite hard to picture. But if we reduce the universe to a two-dimensional object, it's a bit easier. So what I have here, which the RRI dimension kindly provided, is a black balloon with some nice galaxies stuck on it. and I'm now going to turn on an air pump, and hopefully it won't all go bang. It will be quite loud though. Here we go. So as the balloon grows, I'll step away, the galaxies all get further and further apart, and the further they are away from each other, the faster they are retreating. So I will stop this before I actually get a big bang. Right, so we'll just let the universe slowly deflate now. I don't know how educational that really was, But did it help? Now, so Hubble described this relationship. It became known as Hubble's law. I don't think he called it Hubble's law. I guess other people did. And it's a very simple equation. So basically, V, which is the speed the galaxy is retreating from us, is related to its distance, D, by this parameter H naught, which is what became known as Hubble's constant. Now, Hubble and his colleague, Humerson, made the first measurement of Hubble's constant back in 1931. And they got this number. So this is probably rather inscrutable. They got 500 kilometers per second per mega-parsec. So what does that mean? Well, it means that a galaxy, a mega-parsec away, will be moving away from us at 500 kilometers per second. Now, what's a mega-parsec? It's about three million light years. So it's a long way away, basically. So we're talking very large distances. We're talking intergalactic distances. The problem with this measurement of Hubble's constant was that essentially this is saying the universe is expanding very quickly. The bigger Hubble's constant is, the faster space is expanding. Now, this meant that if you rewound the clock to the big bang, the universe only ended up being about a billion years old. But if you speak to a geologist, they have a bit of a problem with this because they have found rocks that are three or four billion years old. So it appeared that the Earth was somehow older than the universe itself. And as astronomers made more and more precise measurements, they gradually realized, oh, actually, there were some mistakes Hubble's original analysis, the number fell to 180, then it fell again to 100 kilometers a second in the 1970s. Actually in the 1970s there was this vicious debate between two different groups of astronomers, one who thought Hubble's constant was 100, another who thought it was 50. So this is essentially because measuring distances is hard. The difficulty here is actually the key thing you need to do is measure how far away a galaxy and that is very, very difficult to do, even using Henrietta Swan-Levitt's Sepheid variables. Now, this Hubble constant is where the anomaly, I'm finally getting to the point now, is where the anomaly that occupying cosmologists lives today. But it's not this 100 versus 50, it's much more subtle than this. But just to sort of establish why this matters, the Hubble constant essentially tells us how old the universe is, and it tells us how big it is. So it's fundamentally crucial to our understanding of the universe around us. Now, this debate over whether it was 100 or 50 was finally settled by this wonderful instrument, the Hubble Space Telescope, launched at the start of the 1990s. Now, Hubble was used to make a wide-ranging survey of cephalod stars. So here's a lovely photograph of a cephalod taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, so you get these really beautiful measurements of these pulsating stars. And this allows you to make more accurate distance measurements. But what Hubble also allowed astronomers to do was to extend the distance ladder even further out into the universe. There comes a point where you're looking at galaxies that are so remote that you can't resolve individual cepheids. So to measure their distances, you need a different what we call standard candle. So this is essentially how this is done. So this is a diagram representing what we call the cosmic distance ladder. There are three rungs on this ladder. The first one uses a technique known as parallax. So we can use this essentially to measure distances to stuff in our local galactic neighborhood. Now, parallax may sound fancier mathematical, but it's the thing we all use to judge distances if we have two eyes. So essentially, the way that we judge distances is that our two eyes have slightly different viewpoints, and that means objects appear slightly differently in the two images, and that allows us to create a sort of 3D model of the world. Now, our eyes are far too close together to be able to tell the differences between different stars, but the Earth orbits the sun, and at six-month periods apart, it's 300 million kilometers apart. And that gives you a long baseline. And you can use that essentially to see how stars shift in the sky and get a measurement of distance. Then you use cephids. That allows you to measure distances out to about 100 million light years. But then beyond that, you use another object known as a type 1a supernova. So this is a photograph of the galaxy, NGC 2525. I hope I've got that right. This was a supernova that went off in 1994. So this is actually a picture taken by Hubble. So you can see the spiral galaxy. And then this little dot here is the Type 1A supernova. This is essentially the dead husk of a sun-like star that detonates violently and briefly outshines the entire galaxy. And it's believed that Type 1A supernovae basically all go off with a similar brightness. So if you calibrate how bright they are, and you can see these things incredibly far away because they're so bright, you can use them again. to measure distance. Hubble made these new measurements, Cepheids and Type 1A, Supernovae, and it got a new measurement of the Hubble constant. Oops, a daisy. And it came out at 72 plus or minus eight. So not 100 and not 50, they were both wrong, actually. It was somewhere in the middle, which is not perhaps altogether surprising. So come 2001, the Hubble Key project had completed its work. The debate of the Hubble constant was done and dusted. Why would you bother measuring it again? We kind of know the age of the universe. how big it is, fine, we could all go home. But then something happened. So in 2013, this lovely instrument, which is the Planck spacecraft launched by the European Space Agency, produced its first results. Now, Planck was a very special spacecraft. It wasn't looking at stars or galaxies, it was looking at the Big Bang itself. So Planck did a survey of what we we know as the cosmic microwave background. This is the faded light from the Big Bang itself. And it produced, essentially, if you think about what we see when we look out into the universe, this is a diagram representing the observable universe. We're in the middle, although we're not really in the middle of the universe. It just looks like that from where we are. And as because light travels at a finite speed, the further out you look, the further back in time you look. So as you move through this image, you see the sun in the middle of the planets, Then you see the Milky Way and distant galaxies. As you go further and further, eventually you see this dark band. That is essentially a time before the first stars formed. If you keep looking, you will look far enough back in time that you see the primordial fireball that filled the universe at the very beginning. That would once have been a very bright, radiant fireball, but because of the expansion of the universe, that light has been stretched down to a very cold microwave signal known as the cosmic microwave background. produced the most precise ever map of this radiation. Essentially it took a photograph of the universe as it was about 380,000 years after it was born. So this is the oldest picture we can get, or sorry the youngest picture really, we can get of the universe. Now what you're looking at here, these different colors represent regions of the universe that were slightly hotter and denser than others. So the blue bits are a bit empty and a bit colder, the the brighter yellow and red bits are a bit hotter and a bit denser. Now, these are very subtle temperature fluctuations, but by studying it, you can get a treasure trove of information about the universe. In particular, you can use this data to figure out how much dark energy there was in the early universe, how much dark matter there was, how much radiation, how much ordinary matter. And with that information, you can plug it in to Einstein's general theory of relativity and you can run the clock forward. So essentially, you have this data from the very earliest moments of the universe, and then you can use it to predict how fast the universe ought to be expanding today. So you have these two different methods, essentially, for measuring the Hubble constant. One is using galaxies, and you measure it, essentially, by stuff that we can see. The other, you look at the Big Bang, and then you predict what it should be. So in principle, if your cosmological theory is right, you should get the same answer. But when Planck published their result, it disagreed. So they get a value of 67 plus or minus 1.2. When this result, and at this point, the measurement by Hubble had been updated by another team who had reduced the error substantially. So now you had these two numbers that are in really quite, you know, noticeable tension with each other. Now, this led to a huge amount of scrutiny, particularly for the team that had used the Hubble Space Telescope, because people basically said, oh, you've got it wrong, you've misunderstood, you measure distances wrong, and they have basically spent the last decade drilling into their methods, repeating the measurements over and over again with more data from more telescopes to firm up this measurement of the Hubble constant. And this Hubble tension, as it's become known, has become a real crisis in some sense in cosmology. So how can you have two different measurements of the expansion of the universe that give you different answers? Well, one again, as I said earlier, they're always boring explanations. A boring explanation is we don't know how to measure distances, for example. But the exciting explanation is there is something profound missing from our understanding of the universe. Perhaps the standard cosmological model is incomplete. There is something missing from this picture. Now this would not be terribly surprising when you consider another name for the standard cosmological model is the Lambda CDM model. Lambda stands for dark energy and CDM stands for cold, dark matter. So the two things that dominate your theory of the universe are completely unknown. So it perhaps wouldn't surprise you if there was something else that you hadn't seen. So the Hubble tension could be the clue to something new that we don't understand about the history of the universe. And that's why it became so tremendously exciting. The problem was ultimately that the debate over the Hubble tension came down to people not really trusting the measurements of distances based on these cephalod stars. As I said earlier, the cosmic distance ladder basically relies on these cephalod to act as a bridge between stuff we can measure in our local galactic environment and much more distant stuff out in the very, very, very distant universe. If that middle rung is wobbly, then the whole ladder might collapse, essentially. So the question was, could we really trust these Sephiod stars? The reason people perhaps were suspicious of these stars is that because they are young sort of pulsating stars, they form in the star-forming dust lanes of spiral galaxies. So here we can see a really beautiful image of NGC 5468, which is actually the furthest galaxy that we can resolve individual Sephiod stars in. I think around 130 million light years away. So these cepheids, they live in these dust-forming regions. And if you have dust, that can block the light from the cepheid. And that could make them appear dimmer or redder than they actually are. And that then can lead you to misestimate the size of the universe. What everyone has been waiting for with baited breath to resolve or help to resolve this puzzle is this beautiful thing. So this is the James Webb Space Telescope, or at least when it was being constructed here on Earth. It is in some sense the sort of spiritual successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. It's been decades in the making this incredible, vast, you know, gold-colored mirror. And what James Webb essentially his job is to look at the universe, but unlike Hubble, which mostly looked at the universe in the optical spectrum, in visible light, James Webb looks at the universe in infrared. Now that's key. So here we can see web being launched. It went up on Christmas day 2021, which is a real, I think, a real sort of, you know, squeaky bum moment, as people say in science or in other fields as well, where you have this incredible, you know, multi-billion pound instrument on the top of a massive bomb, essentially, that's being blasted into space. But amazing, the whole thing went off without a hitch. Web made its way out to a Lagrange point, very distant from Earth, unfolded this incredible mirror and its solar shield, and it's been making beautiful observations of the heavens ever since. And here is one of the results of Web's observations. Here is that same galaxy, NGC 5468 again, but this time superimposing onto the visible light measured by Hubble, the infrared measured by Web. And when the team that were were measuring the Hubble constant, re-performed their analysis using this new data from James Webb, their number, the number of the Hubble constant landed bang in the same place. So this removes one of the major challenges to really believing that the Hubble tension actually is an anomaly that is showing us the way to a new understanding. So we're now in this incredibly exciting moment actually. I think there have been many skeptics about this particular anomaly over the years, not all of them are persuaded, but I think increasingly, from talking to cosmologists, they're becoming increasingly convinced that there really is something that we do not understand about the universe. So what could this mean? Well, one of the reasons that the Hubble tension actually took so long to be accepted is essentially, there isn't really a ready-made theoretical explanation for this. Now, one of the driving figures behind this whole story is an astronomer called Adam Rees. Now, Adam Rees became very famous as one of the co-discoverers in the late 1990s of the accelerating expansion of the universe. So he and a team, and actually two different teams of astronomers, discovered that galaxies are actually accelerating in their expansion. And this led to the realization that the universe is permeated by this stuff that we call dark energy. Now, when I asked Rees, why do you think that the accelerating expansion was accepted relatively quickly, whereas this weird thing with the Hubble constant hasn't been? He said basically that back in the 1990s, there was a ready-made explanation for the accelerating expansion. Way back in time, when Einstein was putting together his general theory of relativity, he actually added an extra term to his equations that he called the cosmological constant. The job of the cosmological constant was essentially to stop the universe from collapsing. What Einstein realized was that under gravity, the universe ought to just implode on itself, and yet it seems nice and stable and static. We added this repulsive anti-gravity force to his equations to prevent the universe from falling in on itself. Now when Hubble discovered the universe was expanding, there was no longer any need for dark energy because essentially the universe is getting bigger, so it's just kind of momentum effectively that's carrying it to carry on getting larger and larger. You don't need this repulsive force. But when the acceleration of this expansion was discovered, then there was this ready-made thing. Einstein's cosmological constant gets reintroduced and in his flash it explains the observations. There was a ready-made theoretical explanation. This time around, there isn't one. Now I think it's, in some ways, it's a rather old way of looking at science to say, I won't believe the data unless there's a ready-made theoretical explanation for something. Ultimately, science is about the universe as we find it, so we can't really use our prejudices or our presuppositions to sort of decide what we include or what we don't. But it seems increasingly clear that if you want to explain this anomaly in the expansion of the universe, there isn't going to be one single solution. It may be that it's a combination of different effects. So a very popular explanation is something known as early dark energy. So a kind of force that shaped the universe in its very earliest history around a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, but then faded away in the later universe, but then perhaps combined with dark matter that interacts with itself in the later universe. more profoundly, actually, one possible set of explanations is that Einstein's theory of relativity itself needs revising, and we need a new theory of gravity. So we don't yet know how this story is going to end, or how this anomaly is going to be resolved, but it seems increasingly likely that it really is telling us something big about the universe that we do not understand. So I think that's tremendously exciting. Now, these are just two stories that I've covered, there are a whole bunch of anomalies out there in the work. So the book covers actually five big stories that are dominating particle physics and cosmology. For example, particles with impossible energies that are bursting from beneath the Antarctic ice and neutrinos that are turning up unexpectedly in experiments with no apparent explanation. Now with any anomaly, the most likely explanation for it is ultimately the boring ones. anomalies go away. Usually they are an experimental mistake or theoretical miscalculation or just a bit of bad luck. But every so often they are the clue to a profound new view of the universe and that is why I find them so exciting and that's why I decided to tell this story tonight and in the book. So if you've enjoyed this lecture I do encourage you to pick up a copy where you can read all about the anomalies that are perplexing physicists today and also how they've shaped our understanding of the universe in the past. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "transcript_length": 9925, "reference_summary": "On New Year's Eve in 1859, rural doctor and amateur astronomer Edmund Lescarbeau receives an unexpected visit from Urbain Le Verrier, France's renowned astronomer. Le Verrier, troubled by the erratic orbit of Mercury, is eager to investigate Lescarbeau's recent letter describing a strange object he observed crossing the sun. Convinced that Lescarbeau may have discovered a new planet, which he hypothesizes could explain Mercury's peculiar behavior, Le Verrier conducts a thorough inspection of Lescarbeau's equipment and interrogates him, even seeking character references from neighbors. By January 2, 1860, Le Verrier announces the discovery of a new planet, Vulcan, igniting international excitement and elevating Lescarbeau's status in the astronomical community. Despite initial enthusiasm, subsequent searches for Vulcan yield no conclusive evidence of its existence. Over the following decades, astronomers struggle to locate the elusive planet, leading to the eventual conclusion by the early 20th century that Vulcan does not exist. This episode highlights the intersection of amateur observation and professional astronomy, as well as the challenges faced in understanding the complexities of celestial mechanics.", "channel": "The Royal Institution"}

Yn ymlaen i'r leches o'r exteriaethau, mae'n ddorotheod Hodgekin o'r leches o'r exteriaethau. So Dorothy Hodgkin was kind of a teenager, or maybe just a bit younger than a teenager. I think maybe she was kind of 10 or 11 and started reading the books that came out of Bragg's Christmas lectures from this very room and got so excited about X-ray diffraction, she started doing it. She then became the first and probably only British woman to win a Nobel Prize in Science for her discoveries of the structures of penicillin and insulin. So this was all from that kind of excitement about crystallography, Beth yw'r llwyddon yn ymddiad, ymddiad o'r llwyddon yn ymddiad yn ymddiad o Dorothea Hodgyn. Yn ymddiad o Dorothea Hodgyn yn y gallu gallu gallu. Mae'n gwybod i'r ffordd, mae'n gweithio'r ffordd yn ymddangos. Mae'n gweithio'r ffordd yn ymddangos i'r cystafell cymdeithas. Felly, rwy'n gweithio'r cymdeithas yn ymddangos i'r Ffordd D'Aeth i Hodgfyd. Felly, rwy'n gweithio'r Ffordd D'Aeth i Hodgfyd. Felly, mae'r prifysgau yn ymddangos i'r ffordd.

But actually, they sold this company for about \u00a3300 million. That was pretty big money at the time. The OLED industry is now worth about $45 billion a year. So it's definitely one we should have tried to keep in the UK. But anyway, what went from seeing this luminescence, so suddenly these plasticky materials could emit lights.

In photovoltaics, they've done a lot. In clever things like these kind of smart windows, and these are windows that are engineered to be transparent to visible lights, so you can let visible light through, you can see out of your window, which is pretty good, because that's what you want to do with a window, but they absorb in the ultraviolet in the infrared, so you can generate electricity and then moderate heat into a room through that. There's quite a lot of applying these systems to kind of health monitoring, ac yn diagnostics ac therapeutics.

I am so ridiculously happy to be here and to speak to you tonight about something that interests, I hope, all of us, namely the concept of light. The fact that we are able, right now, to see each other in this room is, of course, because light exists. There's light, it comes from all the way up in the ceiling, the ceiling lamps, it beams down, it bounces on my body, gets into your eye and you are able to see me as I am able to see you now. Now the bigger question, however, is why does light exist to begin with? And in order to answer that question, we have to look at a couple of properties of light tonight. And that's my job, so I'm very happy to take you on a journey to first discuss exactly what do we mean by light, and then hopefully answer the question, why should light be there at all? Now, let's talk about light just for a moment more. Clearly light exists. Again, we can see each other. Now, this is because light, of course, comes from the lamps. And if you go outside, it might come from the sun. But if you go in outer space, space happens to be pitch black, right? And it gives you the impression that, well, in outer space, there's not that much light floating about. But there is. If you are able to take a photograph of what outer space looks like, it actually looks like this. This is a sky map. If you were to take a picture of the universe and people can do that with their satellites. This is from the Planck satellite. Then this is what the universe looks like. Clearly it is not pitch black. In fact, it's more red than it is black. And that is because the universe consists of red light. It's very ancient, very red light, very old, and you're not able to see it with their human eye. Human eye is simply not sensitive to it. It's too red for the human eye to see. This is why we need a satellite like this to pick it up. So we know that the universe is doused in light. My question tonight is not so much where does this particular light come from? By the way, it's called the cosmic microwave background for people who want to look into it. That is a whole lecture by itself. But again, my question is a deeper one. Could the universe have existed without light, this or any other? What would the universe look like? Well, first of all, it wouldn't look like anything because you need lights to look at things, okay? But that's not exactly what I mean. Clearly, if you take away the light from the universe, things might look different, they might behave different, but my question is still deeper. If we were to build a universe and we would not put light in it, could the laws of physics have existed at all? Could reality have existed? The answer, surprisingly, is no. So that makes light a very special thing in the universe. It's not just something that makes us able to look at the universe and make sure that things are connected in different ways. It makes sure that reality can exist at all. Well, that's my job for tonight. So let's talk about physics for a little bit. So if you were to talk about physics, there you go, then there's all kinds of different fields of physics, right? All of these, by the way, are a complete Royal Institution lecture by itself. For instance, you have celestial mechanics up in the lower left corner. This is how planets and stars and gravity behave. You can look at something more, well, deep and mysterious, like quantum physics on the right-hand side. On the left-hand side, you have these beautiful steam engines that you can see here in the museums in London. And the lower part is the gravitational wave physics. That happens to be my particular field. And here's the thing. literature has all these different parts of physics that have their own laws and their own rules and they've all been figured out, most of them, still work to be done, and they all work individually. But if things work individually, it doesn't mean necessarily that they work well together. And that might be a problem that you have one field of physics that says, these are my rules. And if another field of physics that says, no, but these are my rules, and the rules work individually, but they sort of get into trouble with each other. It's sort of like two people having a row, yes? Take two people who don't like each other very much and put them in the same room. Here's somebody with their own sets of rules so and so and here's somebody else with their own sets of rules, but they don't like each other very much. What you then need is a third person to come in and smoothen out their differences. This This is light. That's going to be what we're going to see tonight. We're going to have different parts of physics that like each other, not so much. And light has to exist to make sure that they do. So in that sense, light is a necessary ingredient of the universe because otherwise individual parts don't like each other very much. So what are the individual parts? Well, here they are. There's two ones in particular that we have to make sure that's like get along a little better. One of them is up in the left corner up there. Nature has a universal speed limit. That's the rule of physics. There is a particular velocity in nature that you cannot go faster than. Some of you might know, oh, yeah, I know that number. It's a speed of light. I agree. But it's not trivial that that number exists, that there is a maximum speed number. And just to be clear what I mean by that, I mean that if you try to go faster than this particular velocity, nature is going to stop you from doing it. Nature really doesn't like you to go faster than that particular number. That number, by the way, is 300,000 kilometers per second. That's a huge number. That means if I were to take something that goes with that velocity, let's take light. And let's make it so that I shoot a beam of that stuff up until the moon. It gets there in about one second. That's how fast it goes. It's a very high velocity. So don't worry, you won't get any speed tickets if you're going to go faster than the number. It's going to be very difficult to do so. But that's one of the rules of physics that nature really wants to adhere to. There's another one. Nature loves to have symmetries. Now what I mean by symmetry, we will see in due course of tonight. Okay, now here's the thing. Those two don't like each other very much. And this is where something has to step in to smoothen out the difference. And that thing, as we will see, is light. So the fact that nature wants these two guys to play along means that light is a necessary ingredient. This might be a little abstract at this point. So let me give a quick example. Suppose that I were to take a nice pot of tea here. And it just comes out of the kettle. Then this is about 80-ish degrees or so, right? Scorched my lips if I tried to drink it. Yeah, that's a sucky thing. That's not symmetric. Why? Because my body happens to be 37 degrees. The cup of tea is about 80. That's an asymmetry. The numbers are not the same. So Nation says, I don't like that asymmetry very much. I want your lips or the room to be the same temperature as my cup of tea. Now, of course, you all know this because if you put a cup of tea over here, at some point the room and the cup of tea will have the same temperature. It will smoothen itself out. Yes? This is nature's trick to try to make everything be the same. Get a symmetry back. In this case, it would be a temperature symmetry. Now, as you also know from putting a cup over here, that cooling down doesn't happen in zero seconds. It takes a while. It might take a few minutes, it might take a few hours. There is that rule over there. Nature doesn't like whatever it needs to get the cup of tea be the same temperature as the room to happen in 0 seconds. There's a speed limit that says, no, no, no, no, no. You have to wait your turn. You have to make it slower than that particular velocity. Now, that means that something has to come in to make the cup of tea be the same temperature as the room, something has to travel from the cup of tea into the room to smoothen out the asymmetry in temperature. Yes? Now, if this is a little abstract, think about me. I'm from the Netherlands. You can tell from my accent, I'm sure. I wish I had your accent. Your beautiful accent over here. I'm from the Netherlands. So if I want to come to London, and this speed limit says, yeah, yeah, but you cannot do it in 0 seconds, Then you know immediately just from the fact that I'm standing over here that something took me from the Netherlands to here. Be it a car, maybe it was a plane, maybe it was a train, maybe it was my own two feet. But the fact that I could not teleport in zero seconds and I had to use that speed limit tells you something, namely that there must have been something that got me from A to B. Well, that thing, in my case, was not my two feet, it's actually the train, but you know that thing exists. That's what we're going to be here to. That's the same thing with my cup of tea. Something traveled from the cup into the room to get the symmetry right at the same time adhering to the universal speed limit. In case of the tea, that thing is what we call heat. It's an energy. Fine. But we will see that there's other symmetries in nature that also give you something that has to travel. And that thing, as we will see, is light. Exactly because these two things don't like each other. light has to step in to make the traveling go in not in zero seconds but in a bigger amount of seconds. That's the plan for tonight. Now before I go into more detail I think it will be a good idea if we talk a little bit more about what light is exactly. And then we can go into these details and then we can see that light will come out. All right so we're going to do a little bit of of a history lesson, what is light to begin with? Now, that's an interesting thing because light is actually one of the things that was mostly discovered by people working here at the Royal Institution about 150 years ago. There's many people, by the way, this is a field that many people worked on, but some of the people, including Michael Faraday, worked right here at the Royal Institution, and they were investigating something that itself was not light. They were investigating different things. They were investigating on the one hand this thing called electricity, on the other hand they were investigating something that's called magnetism. To us these are relatively well known concepts, right? You put something into the socket and your light bulb will go on, so we sort of use electricity in every day. We'll also use two magnets. We use it to put our grocery list on our refrigerator door. We're sort of used to these two concepts. to those scientists 150 years ago, a little bit more, those are completely new phenomena. And when they were investigating electricity and magnetism, they sort of accidentally found light. So let's go through that history lesson for a moment. Here's some mathematics. Now, don't worry. It's not a mathematics lesson for the people who are in the know these are the famous Maxwell equations. Many scientists work on this, including Michael Faraday. James Colerick Maxwell over there was the person who put everything, all he discovers, into one big cohesive mathematical framework they now call or called the Maxwell equations. Now, we're not going to make it a lesson on mathematics. We're just going to demonstrate both. Let's start with electricity first. So electricity, I can actually demonstrate with this thingy over here. I was shocked a few times today what is sort of setting up this thing. I was wearing a different sweater, the type that attracts electricity. So I got a couple of hundred volts, Ruby, earlier today. Let's see if I can do this without this time. I changed short in the meantime. So what we have is what is called the van der Graaf's generator. And without going into full detail how it works, what it does is it takes these two metallic spheres, fills one of them up with charged particles, electrons, fills the other one up with other charged particles, the opposite charge, and pluses and minuses like to get together. If the distance is small enough, they can actually make the jump. You will get a nice surprise there. So let's actually make that work. Um, t-t-t-t. Frugal. There we go. Oh, you see that? If I'm evil, I'm blaming Frugal now, right? He came here and I got a shock. Okay, so what these two spheres are now doing, by this generator, oh, that's the second one. It's like I'm doing this on purpose. I'm not, OK? So you have these two spheres. They're all both being charged up by the machinery over here. And if you get them close to each other, thanks, Arnold. Then clearly, you can see the jumps of the particles happening. Everybody seen this? Yeah? OK, now I don't dare to touch them anymore. So I'll try to do it over there. And then let's charge them. There you go, one final spark. The house lights can go back up again. Thanks, Arnold. So this was electricity. And people were figuring out how that works. And well, this is what they found. You can actually apparently make pluses and minuses come together. And this is what we call in these formulas over there. That's the capital E number. It's called the electric field. OK. Forget about the electric fields for a moment. Let's look at the other field. Magnets. That, too, was something that was investigated by people 150, 200 years ago because they noticed that some metals really like to attract some other metals. For instance, these two, there we go, like to attract each other. There you go, right? I'm not showing you something you didn't know. Magnus exists. Here too was something that people were investigating and that is called B, because magnetic fields obviously start with the letter B. That was for reasons of history. I wasn't there when they did it, but they decided to call magnetic fields by the letter B. Now here's the point that I'm making. They were investigating these two phenomena individually, and they found that the electric fields are given on the left-hand side, magnetic fields are given on the right-hand side, so far so good. But if you now look at the other side of the equations, there on the right-hand side, you see two new equations. Again, ignore the details of the mathematics, Just notice one thing. Both of these equations on the right hand side have both an E and a B in it. Mathematically speaking, that means electric fields and magnetic fields are not independent thingies. They are related. And this was a big discovery again once other places done here at the Roy institution that apparently you can turn electric fields into magnetic fields. You can turn electricity into magnetism and magnetism into electricity. So let's do a little experiment of that as well. Let's take, for instance, here a nice compass. Yes? OK. So a compass, as you know, wants to point towards the north. And if I put the compass here, Arnold, can I have this view over there? Thank you. Then what you can see here, well, it tries to follow the magnetic field of the Earth. The Earth is one big magnet. It has a small strength, so you don't particularly feel it, but the effect is there. That's why compass needles move towards the north. That's how old people in ships knew where to go. And over here, I have a piece of electricity. It's a wire that contains charged particles, just as we had in the generator over there. But these charged particles have an electric field. Now note that the compass really doesn't care about the presence of electricity. You notice that? It doesn't move at all. But now I'm going to do the following. It's a famous experiment done by Orstedt, a Danish scientist. He hooked up the wire to a battery. If you do that, then lo and behold, Give me a second to hook this guy up. There you go. There you go. You see that? Every time that you see the compass needle move, it's when I attach the other side of my wire to the battery. Here's something interesting that happens. When I put electricity next to the compass, the wire itself, nothing happened. The magnet did not care at all. But at the moment that I actually made the particles in my wire walk about, because that's what you do if you attach it to a battery, particles in the wire walking about, and all of a sudden, my compass knows about this. Apparently, what I've done is I've turned electricity into a magnet. we would now in present day call this an electromagnet. To us, this is well known. To them, this was a complete surprise. Apparently, electric fields do not feel compasses unless you make the electric field move about. That's interesting. But then you can immediately ask yourself the question, does it also work the other way around? I've now turned electricity into a magnet. Can it also turn a magnet into electricity? OK, so people went on experimenting. And we can actually demonstrate that that works as well. Look what I have here. Here's a light bulb. It is off. What I have here, it's built into this little contraption over here. What you have over here is actually a magnet. It's built into this thing. And note, the fact that there is a magnet there does not give me any electricity. But before, we could make a magnet if we made electricity walk about. So what if we make the magnet walk about? Will that then produce electricity? And sir, can I ask you to be a volunteer? Can I ask you, what is your, do you know your lung capacity by any chance? This is something that you have on the mind? Well, I'm sorry. Why? I actually don't know. Well, we'll just figure it out. Now, what I'm going to ask of you is whether you can blow on this little mill here, yes? And if it turns about, then the magnet will wobble. And if the magnet wobbles, then you have something, you have a moving magnetic field. And if, well, nature is anyway symmetric, you would expect then maybe to the slide to go on. So if you can just give it a little blow. Oh, there we go. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Apparently, the answer is yes. Just as you can, if you wobble about electricity as we did over here, you get a magnet. And if you wobble about a magnet, as the gentleman did over here, you're going to get electricity. Let's see if we can make the effect a little stronger still. This has nothing to do with your long capacity. You have to blow hard to make it work. So can I ask you maybe to hold it up for just a bit? Maybe you can hold up so everybody can see this. OK. And maybe you can just point in this way, because I might want to blow into it. But you know what? My long capacity is not very big either. But this guy's long capacity is pretty big, OK? So let's see what happens if we're actually going to make the effect a little stronger still. So let me plug this guy in. All the way over here. Let's see if it works first. See if we okay. All right. Arnold, can we have the house lights go down for just a bit? Thank you. Ah, okay, there we go. There is a nice piece of light there. Can have an applause for my two volunteers. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now, these experiments, again, were already done. We're still in our history lesson here. These experiments were done already some time ago. Let's talk about light now, okay? Because we were discussing how people found out what light was to begin with. Clearly people knew what light was because people have been looking at it. had been measuring, people had actually measured the speed of light, that was at number 300,000 kilometers per second, but these people, like Maxwell and their friends, were not investigating any light, they were investigating magnets and electricity and whatever relationship that they have, and this happened to be the result. Now again, ignore the mathematics, just remember wobbling the one gives the other. And then Maxwell, the scientist, this one, asked himself the following question. Wait a minute, doesn't that mean that if I wobble this magnet about, I should get electricity. We just saw it demonstrated. So I wobble this, I get electricity. But electricity itself, if it wobbles, just like the compass, you get back magnetism. But if magnetism wobbles yet again, you get back electricity. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. The experiments that we just did showed that this is in principle possible. He could now ask this question then, well, OK, well, does this wobbling back and forth and back and forth, does it stay in one place, or does itself move through space? Does it go from A to B? And Maxwell took these equations, and he figured it out. He had to play with the mathematics a little bit, and then he actually found the following. This is an animation. He found that if you wobble the electric field that's in blue, then it makes magnetic fields. That's in red. And they change back into electric, back, forth, back, forth, back, forth. And that indeed travels through this room from A to B. And his formulas even told Maxwell how high a velocity this back and forth traveling had. And the number that he found was 300,000 kilometers per second. That was the speed of light that people already had measured in completely different ways without knowing electricity and magnetism. That was an enormously big discovery. So Maxwell himself, a scientist, said in nice archaic English, and I'm not a native speaker, so you might have to help me out here a little bit. We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transfers undulations of the same medium which is a causal magnetic phenomena. Okay, let's translate that in normal plain English, okay? It says is, I have discovered that light is just a wobbling of electromagnetism. That's what it says. Now, there were no Nobel prizes back in those days. We're talking about the 1860s or so, but he clearly would have gotten it. He had discovered what light was all along. Now, that is a very, very big discovery. Okay, so that is our history lesson. So we have an understanding of light now. Now, again, I don't want you to understand these equations in full, but do, well, make a little mental snapshot of what they look like. Okay, let's speak again. There you go. Everybody got the snapshot? Yeah, okay, good. All right. We're now going to see whether this electromagnetism is a necessary ingredient of the universe, right? That was our original question of this evening. And if you now notice by having this little detour into history, I sort of, well, made the question bigger. The original question was, could the universe have existed without light? Now we know that light is just the transverse undulations of electromagnetic phenomena, so on and so forth. The wobbling of electromagnetic fields, the question now is, OK, could you have made a universe without electromagnetic fields? And as a consequence, what you'll have had light. That is now the bigger question we're going to answer. And as I promised at the beginning, we're going to have two rules fighting with each other. And this electromagnetism has to come here and clean up the tension between two thingies. So we're going to build a universe. We're going to start with the universe. No electromagnetism at all. No electric fields, no magnetic fields. We're going to have some space and time in there. Do I have a universe? What's on space? Time flows? We're going to put some particles in there. It doesn't even matter what kind of particles, electrons, protons, take your pictures. Put some particles in there. Yes, you need stuff in the universe. OK. In my story right now, I'm going to first look at the first rule that nature has a universal speed limit. Yes? It is the speed of light. We don't know it yet because we don't have light in our story yet. But I'm going to show you that there must exist a universal speed limit. Then we're going to talk about, OK, but what's that second ingredient? The existence of symmetries. And again, I will explain to you what those things are when we get there. And it's those two things, if you recall, they're going to fight with each other unless Electromagnetism jumps in to smoothen out the difference. That is going to give us a rule about the existence of special particles. Those are not light particles yet, maybe the photons. Electromagnetism, you can also see, is small particles of light floating about, called the photons. But we will see that to make the tension go away, we're going to need new particles. And then the only question remaining is, OK, of all particles we will need are those photons? Are those the photons that make up electromagnetism? And in order to get that, we're going to sprinkle over our small universe a small amount of quantum mechanics. And then, once we have done that, we will have light. All right. So let's look at all the ingredients apiece. First ingredient was, well, we're going to need the universal speed limit. At this point, some people already somewhat didn't know in physics. In fact, there is an individual over there that is one of my former students. Hi, Andreas. Nice to see you. So I'm sure he knows the answer. And some people might as well, yes, because indeed, the universal speed limit, this velocity you cannot go faster than, is the speed of light. But remember, we don't know it yet. We don't know about light. So I'm going to have to get this universal speed limit for someplace else. So that is what I'm going to discuss with you now. So I have to get it from some other part of physics. You can actually get it from balloon physics. It don't laugh at me, OK? I'm standing here with my balloon. I'm a middle-aged man holding a balloon in the center of London. But there is a point to this. Now, we know that the balloon, in this particular case, is filled with helium. Helium has its night property. It's a special gas. It's named after the sun, because people investigated that there must be some special gas in the first place they found it was in the sun, so they named it after the sun god Helios. So that's why it's called Helium. Helium wants to go up because it's lighter than air, it wants to float on air. Helium is in the balloon. In the rest of the room there's just normal air. Particles. Particles flying about, bouncing about. Let's also pretend we don't even know about the particles either in the balloon or in the room. Even without knowing anything about the particles here or in the balloon, there's one thing I can immediately conclude about whatever's going on in the balloon and whatever's going on outside of the balloon. The in and the outside of the balloon must share some number that is equal to each other. How do I know this? the balloon is not changing. It's not changing shape. Now, I don't dare to let it go, Ferkel, would you mind holding it for a moment? Here's another man holding a balloon in the middle of London. This is not a triviality. The fact that this balloon is not changing shape, it's not getting bigger or smaller. I mean, I can easily make a balloon make its shape become bigger or smaller. Here, look at this. So what I did there, I put on a vacuum pump. It just sucked out a little air from the little container over there and that means the particles on the inside are bouncing a little stronger, pushing the balloon out and the particles on the outside are pushing in because I removed the particles from the outside a little bit. Then the balloon is is now getting bigger and as it was changing, this is when the change of the balloon happened. When I changed the inside of the container, the balloon also changed. It stopped changing now, agreed? So that means, well, whatever is going on in the balloon now, it is again, has turned into the same number as outside of that balloon. Now, if you know about your bouncing particles, then you know that that same number is simply called the air pressure. But even if you had not known anything about bouncing particles in the air, just the fact that inside and outside at some point do not change anymore is another way of saying there must be a shared number between inside and outside. Even if you don't know anything about particles, we do because we live in a modern age, but just the fact that it doesn't change anymore. And I can make it stronger still because here's another balloon. I have no idea where there's helium in there. You sure it wants to go up, but other gases do too. So I don't even know what this balloon is filled with. But yet again, I know exactly that there is a number that is shared between this balloon inside and the outside world. Slightly stronger still, I even know that whatever the number is, must also be the same number between the two balloons. Now, this all sounds very trivial, But there's a very deep rule that's going on over here. The rule that I'm talking about is this one. There's a rule. Very abstract. If there's two thingies in nature, for instance, the two balloons, A and B. And they agree on C, C being now the rest of the room, then there must exist a number that is the same in between those two balloons and the rest of the room. Again, we know that number because we know about bouncing particles. But that number is what we call air pressure. But even if we didn't, we wouldn't be able to conclude that that number exists. Yes? Now, remember this rule because this rule applies at many places in physics. In fact, I'm going to demonstrate yet another one right now. And once you grappled with this rule, then we can find that there must exist yet another number that is shared with all. That's going to be the speed of light. So let's see. I have a nice ring here. Let's see if I can give somebody a ring. Well, here's a person. Would you mind giving if I gave you a ring? Do you have any significant other around that might beat me up later? I hope not. This is all for science, OK? Just put the ring on one of your fingers if you can. Can you tell me what color it is now? It's a green one. OK. Does it stay green, though? OK. Start up with green. It's getting purple-blue. Something is changing that meant when you put the ring on, some number between you and the ring was not the same yet. And nature is now trying to make those two numbers the same. Yes? I can do better still. I also have two of these. Oh. It's also a gravity experiment that I'm showing you now. Now I just dropped the thing. I have another two of these rings right here. By the way, these are called mood rings. You might know them a few decades ago. This was sort of a fat in the world. And apparently, the color of the ring tells you what mood you're in right now. So what is yours at this moment? Multi-colored? What's the dominant one? purple. When I bought it, they gave me an actual legend that tells me how you're feeling right now. Extreme trepidation, is that close to what you're feeling? It actually says romantic. So I have two of these, I also brought two of these wings and I put them on my finger and they too are changing, yes, changing their color. Now, if you give it a little while, because it takes a while, remember, it takes a while for things to find their new equilibrium together, then note, mine, do you see that, are also becoming greenish, so and so. Now, what does it tell you, given this rule that you have on the board now, about those two rings, ring A and ring B, apparently they agree on something, Namely, see, that's me. Okay? Oh, they do, because they have found the same color. By the way, what's yours now? Filled with very multicolored. So you're going through a whole range of sentiments now. Okay. I'll try not to. Thank you very much. Can I have an applause, by the way, for just getting my ring there. What does it tell? I mean, let's focus on me and my two rings, yes? One ring, A, one the other ring, B, attached to me, C. And the two rings apparently are in agreement about me because they turn to the same color. What does it say about me and the two rings? There's something that is the same. Some number must be the same. In this particular case, indeed, that number is the temperature. It doesn't quite, as far as I can tell, I'm joking a little bit there, it doesn't quite react to your sentiment. What it reacts to is your temperature. So if we keep up these rings long enough, they should all get the same color because human beings tend to have the same temperature. But here too, even if we had not been able to ourselves feel with our body's temperature and thermometers did not exist, we would be able to tell some number is shared between all of us in those rings. That's again an application of this rule. OK, but we were planning to talk about the existence of a speed limit, the biggest speed limit. OK, let's make it a little bit more abstract still. There is a highest velocity in nature. Yes, it's a speed of light. And when Einstein, who sort of brought up this number, he found it by looking at electromagnetism. But that's not the route that we're taking because we have a universe that doesn't have magnetism in it at all. So but we do have a new rule. We have that if A and B agree and C, then there must exist some shared number. Now, can I take you as an example? Just for a second. Can I ask you what is your favorite vegetable? Potato. I'm more of a broccoli person myself, but potato is good. Yes? If I ask you what your favorite vegetable is, you say potato. Now, suppose I'm not going to ask somebody on stage, but suppose somebody would have come on stage and that person is walking with respect to the gentleman over here. That means that person and myself are not the same person, right? We have a velocity with respect to each other. If that person would now ask the gentleman over here his favorite vegetable, I think we can all agree that you will still say it's potato, right? And that is of course because there's nothing about you and your favorite vegetables that's going to change simply because this person and my hypothetical other person are moving with respect to you. Let's do this in terms of this rule again. By the way, this is called the principle of volatility. That nature, that will be you in this case, is completely indifferent to whether you're looking at it from a velocity or looking at it from a stationary position as I am right now. Your love for potatoes has nothing to do with doing this or doing that. That's what we call the principle of relativity. But wait a minute. That means that there is now a person A. That's me. There's a person B, that was the walking person, agreeing on person C. Then this rule says that we just found that there must exist a shared number. That number is not temperature. That number is also not air pressure. That number is a velocity. There's a number that all of us agree on, no matter how fast we are ourselves we are moving. That number is itself a velocity. So from this little thought experiment, you can derive the existence of a number, a special velocity that's the same to everybody. That number is, well, a special velocity. By the way, you can actually turn this into mathematics. So for the people, maybe want to actually see this, everything that I've now been saying into a mathematical structure, you can go over there. Right now, I hope the message is clear. A and B agree on C, then a must exist shared number. In this particular case, that number is itself a velocity. By the way, it's a velocity because this person, myself, and the new person, also asking you your favorite vegetable, themselves differ by a velocity, agreed? OK, but that means that that shared number must sort of mop up the difference between those two velocities. That makes a shared number a velocity. And as a final step to this argument, we just have to put in that a shared velocity must also be a highest velocity. Remember, that was a speed limit we were looking for. Now, how do you figure? How is the fact that we all agree on a particular velocity mean that it's also the highest velocity? It's actually not that difficult. Suppose that this special velocity, let's call it C. Yes? Yes. In physics, there is a speed of light, but I'm not assigning a number to it. I'm not saying who goes with this velocity. Simply saying that it exists. OK. If that velocity exists, and suppose that I'm going with that velocity, and if I can take this gentleman, you just have to sit tight. You don't have to do anything, but it's just you too, as an example. If I go with this velocity, and both of you will have to agree that I go with that velocity, because that's what it means when you have a shared number. Suppose that it is not the highest velocity. That means if you come running after me, then you should at least, because you can go faster than me, you should at least be able to go along with me, yes? But what is the velocity between you and me if you're running along with me? How much velocity do we have with respect to each other? That's zero. But wait a minute, the gentleman over there who is not walking along says, no, no, no, no, no. I get whatever the number C is, if you're on a thousand kilometers per second. But we should share the numbers with each other. You cannot have this rule that it should be the same number. And at the same time, somebody is saying it's zero. On the other hand, somebody is saying it is a different number. So that means my premise that you are able to walk along with me is flawed. By saying that it's not the highest velocity, I'm able to construct a situation where this is broken, that you do not agree anymore on that this is our highest velocity, or that's the same velocity. That means it must be the highest velocity. This argument, too, is worked out in more mathematics over there. But the point that I'm making here is apparently there exists a velocity in nature that is the highest and is shared with everybody. And I didn't get it from electromagnetism. I got it from different means. I got it from this special ABC rule, so to say. Yes? Now, if you read into the history books, people usually get the number from Einstein or electromagnetism, but remember, we're building a universe without electromagnetism. So, forcibly, we got it from someplace else. Okay, good. Then let's move on to our second ingredient, symmetries. Remember, there are two rules that don't like each other very much. One of them is the universal speed limit. We have that one. The other one is symmetries. So let's talk about what we mean by the word symmetry. And I'm going to use this drill over here. Now, as you can see, it's a wheel attached to it, and it's all kinds of different colors on it. Actually, can I ask you, sir, which colors can you see on it? Red, purple, orange, green, moan, yellow, blue. It's a hot part of different colors, yes? Okay, now, if I'm going to spin this wheel around, can you tell me again what it is that you're seeing? Yellowish. Yellowish? Yellowish. Yellowish, exactly. Yellow, yellow. It sort of blurs together into one color. Now, if you would really have all colors combined together and you would then spin it around, it would become more white. But to my point, it's just a fact that it becomes yellow. Okay. If I can go to the lady over there, can you tell me which colors you can see on this wheel? Different wheel. Purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. Different purple. Different purple, okay. It is actually the same set of colors as that wheel has over there. Okay. And I'm going to spin it again. What is the net color? Probably more paint. Yes. Again it blurs together. Now, those two colors are pretty, so the blurred image, so to say, is pretty similar, right? Now, here's an interesting thing though. I was spinning these things around, they sort of blurred together into every similar colors. But do you see any difference between the two wheels? I hear people say, yes, I see people squinting their eyes and see people sort of, no, I'm not quite seeing it. They're different orders. Same set of colors, as the lady pointed out and the gentleman pointed out. When spinning, it blurs into the spray, much the same color, yet the order is different. This is what we call in physics a symmetry, that you can swap around colors in this particular example, yet the net effect is exactly the same. There's a freedom, so to say, to swap around colors. Yes? That's what we call a symmetry. And nature loves these symmetries. It's full of them. There's an enormous amount. Here's another one. Here's a little ball. Note there is a little wave on top of it. And if I just turn it a little bit, it looks pretty much the same still, right? Still wave, so you can sort of turn this around. And the whole thing doesn't quite look any different. That too is a symmetry. And nature is full of them. Nature loves these symmetries. And these symmetries mean that, well, you should be able, if I stick to this example, to swap two colors around without seeing a difference. Right? But wait a minute. Then we run into trouble. This is where the tension appears between the two wheels. There's a small nuance. There's a thing called the local symmetry and a global symmetry. What I mean by local is that if I take one of these two wheels and I look at the colors, then yes, if it's not spinning And you look at it, you can actually tell it's not quite the same as the other one. You were all able to do this just a second ago. That's a local symmetry. As in, I'm able to swap the colors around on this wheel as long as I don't look at the other wheel, so I can see that the colors were swapped around. But there's also global symmetries. That means you can swap around the colors over here on this wheel. And the colors on that wheel should also change. Nature loves global symmetries, that if you swap around two thingies here, then at this part of the universe, then that part of the universe must also see those two thingies swapped around, because the net effect is the same. Here is where the tension that I was talking about at the beginning comes from. Because we have our two rules, nature loves symmetries, and there's a highest velocity. Here's the tension. The people over here take their color wheel. They swap around two colors. The people over there have their color wheel. But then all of a sudden, there is not a global symmetry anymore, agreed? Because there's two colors swapped over here. But this part doesn't have their color swapped. And nature says, yeah, I cannot have that. I love my symmetries. I want the colors to be swapped everywhere. And nature says, I want this to be done as quickly as possible. But then that rule comes into play, says, wait a minute. If you want this to be done as quickly as possible, 0 seconds, that means something must have traveled faster than this highest velocity. And that is not allowed. So nature cannot have these two rules play at the same time. You cannot do swapping over here and have an immediate swapping over there to get the symmetry just right in all of the universe. The best nature can do is when something is swapped over here, is send some information from there to there to tell this part of the universe, hey, I just swapped something around. You better do it too. That thingy is a new type of particle. If you want these rules to play together, you're going to need new particles that send information from one side to the other. And that's the rule that you have over here. Every time that you have a symmetry, but at the same time, you cannot change things around can also have a change of the world. Over there, something must have traveled to inform the other side of the universe that it happened. Those are special particles. In physics, let's use a complicated word, these are called gauge bosons. Special particles that make sure that those two rules play together. And because nature loves symmetries, and as many of these symmetries built in, you're going to find many of these gauge bosons, many of these special information traveling particles that tells this part that something happened that that part needs to know about. In fact, here's a small list. For instance, if you take a particle in the center of an atom, like a proton, protons themselves consist of smaller particles still called the quarks. There's always three of them. The proton doesn't quite care in which order the particles are in there. just like these wheels over there don't care about the order of colors. It just says, I need three quarks. You can swap them around at will. But it means if there's a proton over here where people swap around the quarks, then that part of the universe, because symmetry, needs to know about this, but it cannot happen in zero seconds. Something needs to travel. That special information particle in that case is called the gluon. And those particles are not hypothetical. You can just measure them. as we measure them very often in our physical experiments. Here's another one. Protons and neutrons also particles in the center of atoms. A proton is like a little ball with plus charge. In fact, it was the little particle that was in one of these spheres over here, the one that makes a spark happen. Neutrons are pretty much the same particle. They don't have charge, but otherwise they weigh the same. They also consist of three quarks. But wait a minute, that means you can change protons and neutrons around, and nothing is going to change. If you take a nucleus, like a gold atom, and the inside is made of protons and neutrons, and you just flip all the protons and neutrons, you still have exactly the same gold atom. And again, if you do it over here, but nature wants their symmetry, it also has to happen over there. So something must travel from that side to the other side to say, hey, you have to also flip around the protons and the neutrons. Because you cannot do it in zero seconds because that breaks the universal speed limit. That means there too must be a particle. That particle is called the meson. And again, those are completely measurable. These particles really exist. Now we can move on, you know. Big rule here is if you have a symmetry in nature, you have a speed limit, there must exist a particle that sends information around. But there's many symmetries, and note that there's one thing missing from our list. It's the photon, the particle of light. And it turns out the photon is also one of those special particles that sends information from one side to the next. But as you now know, it does require you to know that there is a symmetry. There is a symmetry, something can be swapped around, yet you end up with exactly the same, a cryosurve particle, and the question simply is, well, OK, but what is that thing? What is the thing? Which symmetry needs to have a photon to work in the whole of the universe? And this is my final ingredient. We need a sprinkle of quantum mechanics. Only a sprinkle. Quantum mechanics, we're not going to make it a quantum mechanics lecture. just small sprinkle because we need to get our symmetry. What does quantum mechanics say? Quantum mechanics says if you look at very small particles and you look closer and closer still, then every small particle is a little wavy. It does a little bit like this. Yes, that's what we have in my hand here. This is a particle, but there's a little wave attached to it. And the properties of this particle are represented by the properties of the wave. That's what quantum mechanics tells you. For instance, the wavy thing here has a certain amount of spread. How many meters does it take to go up and down? That is the mass of the particle. The more massive the particle is, the smaller the spread is, the more the waves are packed to each other. It also has an amplitude. How high does the wave go? How low does the wave go? red says, well, where is the particle to begin with? This is the only quantum mechanics that you're going to need to my story right now, because as I was demonstrating before, this wave, if you turn it about, question to the audience. Has the spread of the wave changed simply because it turned my particle around? It hasn't, so that means the mass of the particle has stayed the same, even if I've rotated it. Second question, has the position that was how high the wave go, has the position of the particle change because I rotated it around? No. I mean, it's just the same particle or the same wave just rotated around a little bit. That is a symmetry. You can take your particles and rotate their waves a little bit over here. But then, if you rotate it, the particles over there need to know about it too. And because it cannot happen in 0 seconds, something must have traveled from this side to the other to tell the rest of the universe that this rotation has happened. So I'm over here with my particle. I'm rotating it, making the wave go around. The particle over here doesn't change. But that part of the universe doesn't know about it yet. So you guys are the yellow particles. Over here, there's the blue particles. And if I rotate this around in nature, And once it's symmetry back, it will have to send information over there because it cannot do it in zero seconds. And low and behold. There we go. The other guy will move along. It takes a while because it has to travel. That is that rule that you need over there. That was what we found before. Those are two rules fighting with each other. We found this beautiful list that if you have symmetries and information has to be center round, you just have to look for the right symmetry to get the right particle back, the right gauge pose on our steezers called. And in this particular case, the symmetry that we're looking for is the freedom, so to say, to flip around particles in quantum mechanics. And lo and behold, if you take that and actually put it into mathematics, here it is, you put it into mathematics, then mathematics tells you these are the formulas that those particles, they travel from A to B should behave as. Do you remember these particles? These or sorry these formulas. I asked you to make a snapshot of this from your memory right? These are Maxwell's equations. So when people figured this out, this is a few decades ago in the 1950s, 60s so on so forth, all of a sudden they understood that not just how electron-magnus isn't worked, it was really because of the symmetry of quantum mechanics, the rotating of the waves, the quantum mechanical waves of the particles that needs to be sent to the other side because it cannot do it in zero seconds. And the formulas are exactly what people figured out already 100 years before right here, amongst other places at the Royal Institution. So going back to our question, can you build a universe? Without this, and the answer is no. Light photons, electromagnetism is there because nature is extremely vain. She loves her symmetries, but at the same time must also adhere to this speed limit that it has. So what are photons? What is light? Light is nature's way of being symmetric and making sure that the symmetry gets transported all of the universe without ever breaking the speed limit. So as long as you have those two rules, you cannot build a universe without anything that resembles light. And we're extremely lucky because of that light, the existence of this phenomena allows us to study the universe. It allows us to look at each other and have this very beautiful discussion with each other tonight. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

They emphasize that our ability to see one another in the room is solely due to the existence of light, which emanates from sources like ceiling lamps or the sun. However, the speaker poses a deeper question: why does light exist at all? They highlight that while outer space appears dark, it is actually filled with ancient red light, known as the cosmic microwave background, which our eyes cannot perceive. This leads to a profound inquiry into whether the universe could exist without light. The speaker argues that light is essential for reality itself, as it enables us to perceive and connect with the universe. They introduce various fields of physics, such as celestial mechanics and quantum physics, noting that while these disciplines have their own laws, they must also work together cohesively. Ultimately, the lecture aims to deepen our understanding of light's role not just in visibility, but in the very fabric of reality, making it a pivotal topic in both physics and our comprehension of the universe.", "channel": "The Royal Institution"}

According to the general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force. There are no gravitational fields. Gravity is kind of an illusion. And in this video, I will prove it to you by blasting off into outer space. In three, two, one. Albert Einstein said the happiest thought of his life was imagining a man falling off the roof of a house. What made Einstein so happy about this wasn't Schadenfreude. It was the realization that this man while he was falling wouldn't feel his own weight. He would be weightless. And anything he dropped on his way down, well, it would remain stationary relative to him or moving in uniform motion. The whole situation would be just like if If you were in deep space, not near any large masses, with your spaceship at rest or coasting along at constant velocity. Here you would feel no weight. Objects would remain stationary relative to you, or if you give them a push, they would move in a straight line at constant velocity. And you would be the very definition of an inertial observe. not accelerating, not in a gravitational field, all the laws of physics apply in your reference frame. Meaning there is no experiment you could do to distinguish your inertial reference frame from any other. Now here comes the big leap. Einstein looks at these two scenarios and says, they are equivalent, not just similar, physically they are exactly the same thing. Which means man falling from roof is not in a gravitational field. There are no gravitational fields. And he is not accelerating. He is an inertial observer just like Rocketman. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I mean, okay, I can see how both of these observers feel weightless, but man falling from roof is clearly in a gravitational field. I mean, he's right next to the earth. And he's obviously accelerating. His speed is increasing by 9.8 meters per second every second, a fact that would become painfully apparent when he crashes into the ground. I know that these two situations look very different, but Einstein's equivalence principle tells us the one thing to focus on, the experience of the observer. If they feel weightless, then they are in an inertial frame of reference. Every bit as good as Rocketman's, out drifting through deep space. Imagine if Rocketman, coasting along at constant velocity and not paying attention, comes upon a planet, a long way off in the distance. An external observer might notice that the path of the rocket bends ever so slightly towards the planet, but inside Rocketman would remain oblivious. He feels no force, experiences no acceleration. As the rocket gets closer to the planet, it goes faster and faster, but Rocketman still feels weightless. For him, nothing has changed. So where on this journey would you say the frame of reference changes from inertial to non-inertial? An onboard accelerometer would never even register a blip. He has continued on his inertial path through space-time. So the logical conclusion is, his frame of reference is inertial, up until the instant he crashes into the planet. Okay, so how do you explain the curved path of his rocket without gravitational force? forces or gravitational fields. The answer is curved spacetime. First, focus on Rocket Man's observation that the whole time he felt like he was moving with constant velocity in a straight line. He was moving in a straight line through spacetime. But spacetime around massive objects like planets is curved. So that's why his path appeared curved to a distant observer. Now this isn't as unusual as it seems. Airplanes, for example, always try to fly the shortest route between cities. Essentially, they just go in a straight line. But since the Earth's surface is curved, the shortest path doesn't look like a straight line. These shortest paths over curved surfaces are called geodesics, and we use that same word, geodesics, for the straight line paths followed by inertial observers through curved spacetime. Here's another analogy. Imagine you and a friend are standing a thousand kilometers apart on the equator. Now you both set off due north. Over time you will come closer together, ultimately bumping into each other at the north pole. It's as though there was a force pushing you together. But you didn't feel a force, and your friend didn't feel a force. Gravity is just like that force, it doesn't actually exist. The real reason for you coming together was that you were both on straight paths, geodesics, on a curved surface. Astronauts on the space station are weightless. That means they too are inertial observers traveling on a geodesic. But the Earth curves space-time around it, which is why their straight-line path appears as a helix. It only looks like a circular orbit if you forget the time dimension. Don't forget, we are all moving through space and time, space-time. This is the standard bent sheet analogy for curved spacetime. But I think this demo is misleading. It allows you to fool yourself into thinking you understand general relativity when the intuition you're actually drawing on is just that objects like to fall towards the middle of a well due to the gravitational force. But in general relativity, there is no gravitational force. What you should be thinking about is objects traveling on a straight line path through spacetime. It just so happens that space-time is curved around massive objects, so that straight-line path doesn't look like a straight line. Matter tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells matter how to move. Now let's go back to deep space. What happens if you turn on the rocket thrusters and accelerate at 9.8 meters per second squared? Well, someone outside would see all objects remain stationary, while the floor of the rocket accelerates into them. Inside the rocket, everything would appear to accelerate down to the ground, and you would feel a force pushing up on your feet, the same force that's pushing up on you as you watch this video. This situation feels exactly the same as being at rest on the surface of Earth. Because we are at rest on the surface of Earth. Now I want to ask you, are you watching this video in an inertial frame of reference? Well, I mean, do you feel weightless? No. So, you are not an inertial observer. Your situation is exactly the same as someone accelerating on a rocket ship in deep space. And let me be clear, I don't mean that being at rest in a gravitational field is like accelerating in a rocket. I mean, it is the exact same thing. You are accelerating and there is no gravitational field. Gravitational fields do not exist. Now I know that sounds crazy, but come with me for a minute. This is you. In standard Newtonian physics, we draw your weight force, the force of gravity pushing you down, and the normal force from the floor pushing you up. We say these forces are equal and opposite, so there's no net force on you, so you are not accelerating. But in general relativity, gravity is not a force. You have no weight, so the only force on you are these normal forces pushing you up. So you are accelerating upwards, but I'm not moving up relative to what? I mean relative to the flip chart and the floor and basically everything in this room But all of those things are in your frame of reference, which you know is not inertial Relative to everything in my rocket ship. I'm not accelerating What you need if you really want to measure your acceleration is someone in an inertial frame of reference Like the guy who fell off the roof And he would see you accelerating up at 9.8 meters per second squared. I think what this shows is that what an acceleration really is, is it's a deviation from a geodesic. You can't follow a straight line path through space-time because the floor prevents you from doing that. It applies a force upwards on you, so you're accelerating up. But if I'm accelerating up and so is everyone else around the world, and presumably the whole surface of the Earth, then shouldn't the Earth be expanding? No. It is possible for you to be accelerating even though your spatial coordinates are not changing. I will show you one equation from General Relativity. This says that the second derivative of your position with respect to time is equal to your acceleration, that's just f on m, And if you were in flat spacetime, well, this is exactly what you're saying. If you're accelerating, your spatial coordinates have to change. But you're not in flat spacetime. And this term is related to the curvature of spacetime. And this is your velocity through time squared. You don't have to worry about the details here. The point is your position can be not changing. This can be zero, which means your acceleration must be exactly equal to this curvature term times your velocity through time squared. So in curved spacetime, you need to accelerate just to stand still. A lot of this may seem more complicated than Newtonian physics, but one classical mystery looks a whole lot simpler in general relativity, which which is why all objects fall at the same rate. Now I have made a number of videos on this topic, and I would always give the standard Newtonian explanation. The only force on a free falling body is its weight, gmm on r squared, which equals its mass times acceleration. You can cancel the object's mass on both sides of the equation, hence all objects will have this same acceleration. The mystery is why we could cancel these two M's. The one on the left was gravitational mass, the property of an object that creates and experiences a gravitational field. While the M on the right is inertial mass, a measure of resistance to acceleration. Why should these two conceptually different properties be numerically identical? Scientists have spent a lot of time and effort experimentally testing down to around one part in 10 trillion that these two types of mass really are the same. But in general relativity, there is no mystery. All objects appear to fall the same way because they're not accelerating. They're just following straight line paths through space-time until they encounter something that stops them. Like the objects in the rocket ship, they appear to accelerate at the same rate because they're not really accelerating. It's the floor accelerating into them. Now a lot of this might seem pretty far-fetched, as it did back in 1915 when Einstein proposed it, so he very cleverly came up with a measurable prediction that scientists could make to test his theory. Imagine that this rocket ship is coasting through deep space. If you shine a light beam across the rocket ship, well it'll do exactly what you expect. Light travels in a straight line and hits a point on the opposite wall at exactly the same height as the source. But now what if this rocket is accelerating? Well to an external observer they're still going to see the same thing, light traveling in a straight line. But inside the rocket, during the time it takes for the light to travel across the cabin, the rocket will have sped up, so by the time it hits the other wall, it'll hit a little lower than before. So in an accelerating frame of reference, light deflects down. I am dramatically exaggerating the effect. Even if I were accelerating up at 10 Gs, which would probably kill me, the deflection would be on the order of the width of a proton. Still, it shows that an accelerating frame of reference will bend light. So, Einstein reasoned, light must also bend when it passes a large mass. But where do you find a mass large enough? Well, the only obvious huge mass near the Earth is the Sun. So the ideal experiment would be to look at light passing just next to the Sun and see if it is deflected. Say light from distant stars. The problem was of course the Sun is just so bright you can't see stars right next to it. Unless there is a total solar eclipse. Which is exactly what happened in 1919. So Arthur Eddington set out to take pictures of the stars right next to the sun during totality. And what he found by analyzing those pictures was that their positions appeared deflected by the precise amount predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. The result was twice the deflection some had calculated using a strictly Newtonian model. And general relativity has passed virtually every test put to it over the past hundred years or so. there are still more things to try. A well-known and empirically validated finding is that accelerating charges radiate electromagnetic radiation. So, one conceptually simple experimental test would be to compare the behavior of a stationary charge in a gravitational field to a free falling one. If a more Newtonian picture of gravity is correct, well then the stationary charge should not radiate electromagnetic radiation, but a free falling one is accelerating and therefore it should radiate. In contrast, general relativity sees the free falling charge as non-accelerating, it's just going on a straight line path through curved spacetime, whereas the stationary charge is accelerating and therefore it should give off electromagnetic radiation. As far logistical challenges have prevented anyone from actually carrying out this experiment, but what you believe will happen reveals what you truly think about the nature of gravity. Do you think that a freely falling charge will radiate electromagnetic radiation? Or not? Is gravity an illusion? This episode was sponsored by Casada and so I used the sponsorship money to have a rocket you a belt. Casseta by Lutron makes the smart light switches in the rocket ship. They also make remotes, motion sensors, smart plugs, basically every smart switch you could use for turning things in your home on and off. But installing a smart switch isn't rocket science. Just turn off the power to the switch, detach the existing wires, and reconnect them to the Casseta smart switch. What's great about smart switches as opposed to smart bulbs is one switch often controls multiple bulbs, so you can save money by replacing only the switch. And they connect to most smart devices like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit. And you can control them via an app on your phone. So if you forget to turn off the lights in the rocket, no need to go back, just turn them off in the app. You can also use the app to set up schedules, turning the lights on when it goes dark. This gives you peace of mind knowing your family will always come home to a well-lit house. Now we may not have personal rockets yet, but we have smart switches, and the smart choice for these devices is Caseta by Lutron.", "transcript_length": 2536, "reference_summary": "In this video sponsored by Cassata by Lutron, the concept of gravity is explored through the lens of Einstein's general theory of relativity, which posits that gravity is not a force but rather an illusion. The narrator illustrates this by comparing two scenarios: a man falling from a roof and a person in a spaceship coasting through deep space. Both experiences result in a sensation of weightlessness, leading to the conclusion that they are both in inertial reference frames. Einstein's equivalence principle states that if an observer feels weightless, they are not experiencing acceleration or a gravitational field, regardless of their proximity to massive objects.\n\nThe video further explains that while the man falling is clearly near Earth and accelerating, his experience is akin to that of the astronaut, as both feel no force acting upon them. The key takeaway is that the path of the rocket appears curved to an external observer due to the curvature of spacetime around massive objects, not because of gravitational forces. This concept is analogous to airplanes flying the shortest route on a curved Earth, demonstrating that both scenarios involve geodesics\u2014straight-line paths in curved spacetime. Ultimately, the video challenges traditional notions of gravity, emphasizing the importance of the observer's experience in understanding the nature of motion and forces in the universe.", "channel": "Veritasium"}

Imagine you trap your nemesis in a rocket ship and blast him off towards a black hole. He looks back at you, shaking his fist at a constant rate. As he zooms in, gravity gets stronger, so you would expect him to speed up. But that is not what you see. Instead, the rocket ship appears to be slowing down. Not only that, he also appears to be shaking his fist slower and slower. That's because, from your perspective, his time is slowing down. At the very instant when he should cross the event horizon, the point beyond which not even light can escape, he and his rocket ship do not disappear. Instead, they seem to stop, frozen in time. The light from the spaceship gets dimmer and redder until it completely fades from view. This is how any object would look crossing the event horizon. Light is still coming from the point where he crossed, it's just too redshifted to see. But if you could see that light, then in theory you would see everything that has ever fallen into the black hole frozen on its horizon, including the star that formed it. But in practice, photons are emitted at discrete intervals, so there will be a last photon emitted outside the horizon, and therefore these images will fade after some time. This is just one of the strange results that comes out of the general theory of relativity, our current best theory of gravity. The first solution of Einstein's equations predicted not only black holes, but also their opposite, white holes. It also implied the existence of parallel universes, and even possibly a way to travel between them. This is a video about the real science of black holes, white holes, and wormholes. The general theory of relativity arose at least in part due to a fundamental flaw in Newtonian gravity. In the 1600s, Isaac Newton contemplated how an apple falls to the ground, how the moon orbits the earth and earth orbits the sun, and he concluded that every object with mass must attract every other. But Newton was troubled by his own theory. How could masses separated by such vast distances apply a force on each other? He wrote that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man who has a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it. One man who definitely had a competent faculty of thinking was Albert Einstein, and over 200 years later, he figured out how gravity is mediated. Bodies do not exert forces on each other directly. Instead, a mass like the Sun curves the space-time in its immediate vicinity. This then curves the space-time around it, and so on all the way to the Earth. So the Earth orbits the Sun because the space-time Earth is passing through is curved. Masses are affected by the local curvature of space-time, so no action at a distance is required. Mathematically, this is described by Einstein's field equations. Can you write down the Einstein field equation? This was the result of Einstein's decade of hard work after special relativity. And essentially what we've got in the field equations, on one side it says, tell me about the distribution of matter and energy. The other side tells you what the resultant curvature of space-time is from that distribution of matter and energy. And it's a single line. It looks like, oh, this is a simple equation, right? But it's not really one equation. It's a family of equations. And to make life more difficult, they're coupled equations, so they depend upon each other. And they are differential equations. So it means that there are integrals have to be done. So there's a whole bunch of steps that you need to do to solve the field equations. To see what a solution to these equations would look like, we need a tool to understand spacetime. So imagine you're floating around in empty space. A flash of light goes off above your head and spreads out in all directions. Now your entire future, anything that can and will ever happen to you will occur within this bubble, because the only way to get out of it would be to travel faster than light. In two dimensions, this bubble is just a growing circle. If we allow time to run up the screen and take snapshots at regular intervals, then this light bubble traces out a cone, your future light cone. By convention, the axes are scaled so that light rays always travel at 45 degrees. This cone reveals the only region of space-time that you can ever hope to explore and influence. Now imagine that instead of a flash of light above your head, those photons were actually traveling in from all corners of the universe, and they met at that instant and then continued traveling on in their separate directions. Well in that case, then into the past these photons also reveal a light cone, your past light cone. Any events that happened inside this cone could have affected you up to the present moment. We can simplify this diagram even further by plotting just one spatial and one time dimension. This is the spacetime diagram of empty space. If you want to measure how far apart two events are in spacetime, you use something called the spacetime interval. The interval squared is equal to minus dt squared plus dx squared. space-time is flat, the geometry is the same everywhere, and so this formula holds throughout the entire diagram, which makes it really easy to measure the separation between any two events. But around a mass, space-time is curved, and therefore you need to modify the equation to take into account the geometry. This is what solutions to Einstein's equations are like. They tell you how space-time curves, and how to measure the separation between two events in that curve geometry. Einstein published his equations in 1915 during the First World War, but he couldn't find an exact solution. Luckily, a copy of his paper made its way to the Eastern Front, where Germany was fighting Russia. Stationed there was one of the best astrophysicists of the time, Carl Schwarzschild. Despite being 41 years old, he had volunteered to calculate artillery trajectories for the German army. At least until a greater challenge caught his attention. How to solve Einstein's field equations. Schwarzschild did the standard physicist thing and imagined the simplest possible scenario, an eternal static universe with nothing in it except a single, spherically symmetric point mass. This mass was electrically neutral and not rotating. Since this was the only feature of his universe, he measured everything using spherical coordinates relative to the center of this mass. So r is the radius, and theta and phi give the angles. For his time coordinate, he chose time as being measured by someone far away from the mass, where spacetime is essentially flat. Using this approach, Schwartzschild found the first non-trivial solution to Einstein's equations, which nowadays we write like this. This Schwartzschild metric describes how spacetime curves outside of the mass. It's pretty simple and makes intuitive sense Far away from the mass, spacetime is nearly flat, but as you get closer and closer to it, spacetime becomes more and more curved, it attracts objects in, and time runs slower. Schwertschild sent his solution to Einstein, concluding with, The war treated me kindly enough in spite of the heavy gunfire to allow me to get away from it all and take this walk in the land of your ideas. Einstein replied, I have read your paper with the utmost interest. I had not expected that one could formulate the exact solution to the problem in such a simple way. But what seemed at first quite simple soon became more complicated. Shortly after Schwarzschild's solution was published, people noticed two problem spots. At the center of the mass, at r equals 0, this term is divided by 0, so it blows up to infinity, and therefore this equation breaks down and it can no longer describe what's physically happening. This is what's called a singularity. Maybe that point could be excused because it's in the middle of the mass, but there's another problem spot outside of it. At a special distance from the center, known as the Schwarzschild radius, this term blows up. So there is a second singularity. What is going on here? Well, at the Schwartzschild radius, the spacetime curvature becomes so steep that the escape velocity, the speed that anything would need to leave there, is the speed of light. And that would mean that inside the Schwartzschild radius, nothing, not even light, would be able to escape. So you'd have this dark object that swallows up matter and light, a black hole, if you will. Most scientists doubted that such an object could exist, because it would require a lot of mass to collapse down into a tiny space. How could that possibly ever happen? Astronomers at the time were studying what happens at the end of a star's life. During its lifetime, the inward force of gravity is balanced by the outward radiation pressure created by the energy released through nuclear fusion. But when the fuel runs out, the radiation pressure drops, so gravity pulls all the star material inwards. But how far? Most astronomers believed some physical process would hold it up. And in 1926, Ralph Fowler came up with a possible mechanism. Pauley's exclusion principle states that fermions, like electrons, cannot occupy the same state. So as matter gets pushed closer and closer together, the electrons each occupy their own tiny volumes. But Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that you can't know the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. So as the particles become more and more constrained in space, the uncertainty in their momentum, and hence their velocity, must go up. So the more a star is compressed, the faster electrons will wiggle around, and that creates an outward pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure would prevent the star from collapsing completely. Instead, it would form a white dwarf with a density much higher than a normal star. And remarkably enough, astronomers had observed stars that fit this description. One of them was Sirius B. But the relief from this discovery was short-lived. Four years later, 19-year-old Supermonion Chandra Sekar traveled by boat to England to study with Fowler and Arthur Eddington, one of the most revered scientists of the time. During his voyage, Chandrasekhar realized that electron degeneracy pressure has its limits. Electrons can wiggle faster and faster, but only up to the speed of light. That means this effect can only support stars up to a certain mass, the Chandrasekhar limit. Beyond this, Chandrasekhar believed not even electron degeneracy pressure could prevent a star from collapsing. But Eddington was not impressed. publicly blasted Chandrasekhar, saying, there should be a law of nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way. And indeed, scientists did discover a way that stars heavier than the Chandrasekhar limit could support themselves. When a star collapses beyond a white dwarf, electrons and protons fuse together to form neutrinos and neutrons. These neutrons are also fermions, but with nearly 2000 times the mass of an electron, their degeneracy pressure is even stronger. So this is what holds up neutron stars. There was this conviction among scientists that even if we didn't know the mechanism, something would prevent a star from collapsing into a single point and forming a black hole. Because black holes were just too preposterous to be real. The big blow to this belief came in the late 1930s, when J. Robert Oppenheimer and George Volkov found that neutron stars also have a maximum mass. Shortly after, Oppenheimer and Hartlund Snyder showed that for the heaviest stars, there is nothing left to save them when their fuel runs out. They wrote, this contraction will continue indefinitely. But Einstein still couldn't believe it. Oppenheimer was saying that stars can collapse indefinitely, but when Einstein looked at the math, he found that time freezes on the horizon, so it seemed like nothing could ever enter. Which suggested that either there's something we don't understand, or that black holes can't exist. But Oppenheimer offered a solution to the problem. He said to an outside observer, you could never see anything go in, but if you were traveling across the event horizon, you wouldn't notice anything unusual, and you'd go right passed it without even knowing it. So how is this possible? We need a space-time diagram of a black hole. On the left is the singularity at r equals zero. The dotted line at r equals 2m is the event horizon. Since the black hole doesn't move, these lines go straight up in time. Now let's see how in-going and outgoing light rays travel in this curved geometry. When you're really far away, the future light cones are at the usual 45 degrees. But as you get closer to the horizon, the light cones get narrower and narrower. Until right at the event horizon, they're so narrow that they point straight up. And inside the horizon, the light cones tip to the left. But something strange happens with in going light rays. They fall in, but they don't get to r equals 2m. They actually add some tot to that value as time goes to infinity. But they don't end at infinity, right? Mathematically, they are connected and come back in and they're travelling in this direction. And this bothered a lot of people. It's bothered people like Einstein because he looked at these equations and went, Well, if nothing can cross this sort of boundary, then how could there be black holes? How could black holes even form? So what is going on here? Well, what's important to recognize is that this diagram is a projection. It's basically a 2D map of four-dimensional curved spacetime. It's just like projecting the 3D Earth onto a 2D map. When you do that, you always get distortions. There is no perfectly accurate way to map the Earth onto a 2D surface, but different maps can be useful for different purposes. For example, if you want to keep angles and shapes the same, like if you're sailing across the ocean and you need to find your bearings, you can use the Mercator projection. That's the one Google Maps uses. A downside is that it misrepresents sizes. Africa and Greenland look about the same size, but Africa is actually around 14 times larger. The Gall-Peters projection keeps relative sizes accurate, but as a result, angles and shapes are distorted. In a similar way, we can make different projections of 4D space-time to study different properties of it. Physical reality doesn't change, but the way the map describes it does. He had chosen to put a particular coordinate system over space and have a time coordinate. And off you go. It's the most sensible thing to do, right? People realize that if you choose a different coordinate system by doing a coordinate substitution, then the singularity at the event horizon disappears. It goes away. That problem goes away. And things can actually cross into the black hole. What this tells us is that there is no real physical singularity at the event horizon. It just resulted from a poor choice of coordinate system. Another way to visualize what's going on is by describing space as flowing in towards the black hole, like a waterfall. As you get closer, space starts flowing in faster and faster. Photons emitted by the spaceship have to swim against this flow, and this becomes harder and harder the closer you get. Photons emitted just outside the horizon can barely make it out, but it takes longer and longer. the horizon, space falls in as fast as the photons are swimming. So if the horizon had a finite width, then photons would get stuck here, photons from everything that ever fell in. But, the horizon is infinitely thin, so in reality, photons either eventually escape or fall in. Inside the horizon, space falls faster than the speed of light, and so everything falls into the singularity. So Oppenheimer was right. An outside a black hole can never see anything enter, because the last photons they can see will always be from just outside the horizon. But if you yourself go, you will fall right across the event horizon and into the singularity. Now you can extend the waterfall model to cover all three spatial dimensions, and that gives you this. A real simulation of space flowing into a static black hole, made by my friend Alessandro from ScienceClick. Here we'll use this model to see what it's like falling into a rotating black hole. Now I've never been sucked into a black hole, but sometimes it feels like it when I'm stuck on the phone with a spam caller. Fortunately, today's sponsor, Incogny, can help. I used to get several spam calls a day, and they frustrated me so much that I wrote a letter to the Do Not Call registry to get my number removed. But that didn't work. And so I wanted to go on the offensive. I even contemplated making a video where I just mess with spam callers to get some revenge for all the frustration and lost time. But I no longer have to do that thanks to Incogni. There are a lot of data brokers out there that suck up information about you, a bit like a black hole. They collect things like your name, phone number, email address, and even your social security number. And then they sell this information on the open market, which is why we often get calls from people that we've never even given our number to. In Cogni, battles these data brokers. You simply give them permission and they figure out who out there has your data, which laws apply, and then they send them the right letter, with the correct legal terms, to each data broker with the request to remove your information. Now, you could do this yourself, but it's a super tedious process that would take days, weeks, even months, and then you'd have to keep doing it forever. So that's something I definitely don't have the time and energy for. But Incogny makes this really easy. Just sign up and they'll give you a list of companies that have your data, the severity of each claim, and the status of each request. So far they have filed 126 requests for me, 83 of which have been completed, saving me over 62 hours of work. But the best part is, since I signed up, I've hardly gotten any more spam calls.

I want to thank Incogny for sponsoring this part of the video, and now back to space time maps. If you take this map and transform it so that incoming and outgoing light rays all travel at 45 degrees like we're used to, then something fascinating happens. The black hole singularity on the left transforms into a curved line at the top. And since the future always points up in this map, it tells us that the singularity is not actually a place in space, instead It's a moment in time. The very last moment in time for anything that enters a black hole. The map we've just created is a Kruskal-Zechar's diagram. But this only represents a portion of the universe, the part inside the black holes of Enterizon and the part of the universe closest to it. But what we can do is contract the whole universe, the infinite past, infinite distance, and infinite future, and morph it into a single map. It's like using the universe's best fisheye lens. That gives us this Henrose diagram. Again, light rays still always go at 45 degrees, so the future always points up. The infinite past is in the bottom of the diagram, the infinite future at the top, and the sides on the right are infinitely far away. The black hole singularity is now a straight line at the top, a final moment in time. These lines are all at the same distance from the black hole, so the singularity is at r equals zero, the horizon is at r equals 2m, this line is at r equals 4m, and this is infinitely far away. All of these lines are at the same time. What's great about this map is that it's very easy to see where you can still go and what could have affected you. For example, when you're here, you've got a lot of freedom. You can enter the black hole or fly off to infinity. And you can see and receive information from this area. But if you go beyond the horizon, your only possible future is to meet the singularity. You can still, however, see and receive information from the universe. You just can't send any back out. Now think about being at this point in the map. This is at the event horizon, and now your entire future is within the black hole. But what is the past of this moment? Well, you can draw the past light cone and it reveals this new region. If you're inside this region, you can send signals to the universe, but no matter where you are in the universe, nothing can ever enter this region, because it will never be inside your light cone. So things can come out, but never go in. This is the opposite of a black hole, a white hole. What color is a white hole? I mean it's going to be the... It's not going to have a color, right? It's going to be whatever is being spat out of it. It depends what's in there and gets thrown out. That's what you are going to see. So if it's got light in there, it's got mass in there, it's all going to be ejected. So the white hole kind of picture is the time-reversed picture of a black hole. of things fall in, things get expelled outwards. And so whilst a black hole has a membrane, the swartial horizon, which once you cross, you can't get back out. The white hole has the opposite. If you're inside the event horizon, you have to be ejected. So it kicks you out kind of thing, right? Relativity doesn't tell you which way time flows. There's nothing in there that says that that is the future and that is the past. When you're doing your mathematics and you're working out the behavior of objects, you make a choice about which direction is the future. But mathematically, you could have chosen the other way, right? You could have had time point in the opposite direction. Any solution that you find in relativity, mathematically, you can just flip it and get a time reverse solution. And that's also a solution to the equations. Now, we've been showing things being ejected to the right, but they could just as well be ejected to the left. So what's over there? This line is not at infinity, so there should be something beyond it. If we eject things in this direction, you find that they enter a whole new universe, one parallel to our own. We can fall into this black hole, and somebody in this universe here could fall into this black hole in their universe and we would find ourselves in the same black hole. The only downside is that we'd both soon end up in the singularity. I guess I'm just trying to understand where that universe appears in the mathematical part of the solution. Like, can you point to the part of the equation and be like, so that's our universe and then these terms here, that's the other universe or do you know what I mean? Yeah. Well, it's coordinates, right? Somebody right came up with a coordinate system for the earth But only the northern hemisphere and you looked at that coordinate system, right? You looked at it and you said I can see the coordinate system. It looks fine, but Mathematically Latitudes can be negative right you've only got positive Latitudes in your solution. What about the negative ones and they said to you negative ones no southern hemisphere All right? And you've got to go, well, the mathematics says that you can have negative latitudes. Maybe we should go and look over the equator to see if there is something down there. And I know that's a kind of extreme example because we know we live on a globe, but we don't know the full geometry of what's going on here in the sense that Swachil lay down coordinates over part of the solution. It was like him only laying down coordinates on the northern hemisphere. And other people have come along and said, hey, there's a southern hemisphere. and more than that, there's two Earths. That's why it's called maximal extension. It's like, if I have this mathematical structure, then what is the extent of the coordinates that I can consider? And with the Schwarzschild black hole, you get a second universe that has its own independent set of coordinates from our universe. I want to emphasize, right, this is the simplest solution to the Einstein field equations, and it already contains a black hole, white hole, and two universes. That's what you get when you push this map to its limits, so that every edge ends at a singularity or infinity. And in fact, there's another little feature in here, which is that that little point there where they cross, that is an Einstein-Rosen bridge. To see it, we need to change coordinates. Now, this line is at constant cross-call time, and it connects the space of both universes. You can see what the space-time is like by following this line from right to left. Far away from the event horizon, space-time is basically flat, but as you get closer to the event horizon, space-time starts to curve more and more. At this cross, you're at the event horizon, and if you go beyond it, you end up in the parallel universe. That gives you a wormhole that looks like this. So that is hypothetically how we could use a black hole to travel from one universe to another. Hypothetically, because these wormholes aren't actually stable in time. It's a bit like a bridge, but it's a bridge that is long and then becomes shorter and then becomes long again. And if you try to traverse this bridge, at some point the bridge is only very short, right? And you say, well, let me just cross this bridge. But as you start crossing the bridge and start running, your speed is finite, right? The speed of light, roughly. And then the bridge starts becoming stretching, and you never come out the other side. This pinching off always happens too fast for anything to travel through. You can also see this if you look at the Penrose diagram, because when you're inside one universe, there isn't a light cone that can take you to the other universe. The only way to do that would be to travel faster than light. But there might be another way. Schwarzschild's solution describes a black hole that doesn't rotate. Yet every star does rotate, and since angular momentum must be conserved, every black hole must also be rotating. While Schwarzschild found his solution within weeks after Einstein published his equations, solving them for a spinning mass turned out to be much harder. Businesses tried, but ten years after Schwarzschild's solution, they still hadn't solved it. Ten years turned into twenty, which turned into forty. And then, in 1963, Roy Kerr found the solution to Einstein's equations for a spinning black hole. Which is far more complicated than Schwarzschild's solution. And this comes with a few dramatic changes. The first is that the structure is completely different. The black hole now consists of several layers. It's also not spherically symmetric anymore. This happens because the rotation causes it to bulge around the equator, so it's only symmetric about its axis of spin. Alessandro from ScienceClick simulated what happens around this spinning black hole. Space gets dragged around with the black hole, taking you and the particles along with it When you get closer, space gets dragged around faster and faster, until it goes around faster than the speed of light. You've now entered into the first new region, the Ergosphere. No matter how hard you fire your rockets here, it's impossible to stay still relative to distant stars. But because space doesn't flow directly inward, you can still escape the black hole. When you travel in further, you go through the next layer, the outer horizon, the point of no return. Here you can only go inwards. But as you get dragged in deeper and deeper, something crazy happens. You enter another region, one where you can move around freely again. So you're not doomed to the singularity. You're now inside the inner event horizon. Here you can actually see the singularity. And a normal black hole is a point, but in a rotating black hole it actually expands out to be a ring. And there are weird things happen with space-time inside the centre of a black hole, a rotating black hole, but it's thought that you can actually fly through the singularity. We need a Penrose diagram of a spinning black hole. Before the singularity was a horizontal line at the top, here the singularity lifts up and moves to the sides, revealing this new region inside the inner horizon. Here we can move around freely and avoid the singularity. But these edges aren't at infinity or a singularity, so there must be something beyond them. Well, when you venture further, you could find yourself in a white hole, which would push you out into a whole other universe. You can have these pictures whereby you're in one universe, you fall into a rotating black hole, you fly through the singularity, and you pop out into a new universe from a white hole. And then you can just continue playing this game. Extending this diagram infinitely far. But there is still one thing we haven't done, brave the singularity. So you aim straight towards the center of the ring and head off towards it. But rather than time-ending, you now find yourself in another universe. A strange universe, one where gravity pushes instead of pulls. This is known as an antiverse. If that's too weird, you can always jump back across the singularity and return to a universe with normal gravity. And I know this is basically science fiction, right? But if you take the solutions of relativity, you know, essentially at face value, and add on a little bit, which is what Penrose does here, says, oh, look, these shapes are very similar. I can just stick these together. Then this is the conclusion that you get. Now we have, effectively, an infinite number of universes, all connected with black hole white holes all the way through, and you often go to explore. But it'll be a very brave person who's the first one who's going to leap into a rotating black hole to find out if this is correct. Yeah, I would not sign up for that. So could these maximally extended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions actually exist in nature? Well, there are some issues. Both the extended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions are solutions of eternal black holes in an empty universe. As you say, it's an eternal solution. So it stretches infinitely far into the past and infinitely far into the future. And so there's no formation mechanism in there. It's just a static solution. And I think that is part of the reason why black holes are realized in our universe and white holes aren't. Or it might not be. Or it might not be. Well, I'm reasonably, Personally, I'm really confident that they don't exist, right? For the maximally extended Curse Solution, there's also another problem. If you're an immortal astronaut inside the universe, you can send light into the black hole. But because there's infinite time compressed in this top corner, you can pile up light along this edge, which creates an infinite flux of energy along the inner horizon. This concentration of energy then creates its own singularity, sealing off the ring singularity and beyond. So all the white holes, wormholes, other universes, and anti-universes disappear. Does that mean that real wormholes are impossible? In 1987, Michael Morris and Kip Thorne looked at wormholes that an advanced civilization could use for interstellar travel. Ones that have no horizons, so you can travel back and forth, are stable in time and have some other properties, like being able to construct them. They found several geometries that are allowed by Einstein's general relativity. In theory, these could connect different parts of the universe, making a sort of interstellar highway. They might even be able to connect two different universes. The only problem is that all these geometries require an exotic kind of matter with a net negative energy density to prevent the wormhole from collapsing. This exotic kind of matter is really against the loss of physics. I have the pressure that it will not exist. I'm bothered by the fact that we say that the science fiction wormholes are mathematically possible. It's true it's mathematically possible in the sense that there's some geometry that can exist, but Einstein's theory is not just geometries. It's geometries plus field equations. the kinds of properties of matter that matter actually has, then they're not possible. So I feel that the reason they're not possible is very strong. So according to our current best understanding, it seems likely that white holes, traversable wormholes, and these parallel universes don't exist. But we also used to think that black holes didn't exist, so maybe we'll be surprised again. I mean, we have one universe, right? Good. Why can't we have two?", "transcript_length": 5809, "reference_summary": "could happen to you, is represented by a light cone. The shape of this cone illustrates how light travels through spacetime, dictating the possible paths you can take. In the context of black holes, the event horizon marks the boundary beyond which no information can escape. As objects approach this boundary, they appear to slow down and fade from view due to gravitational time dilation and redshift, phenomena predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. This theory revolutionized our understanding of gravity, moving away from Newton's concept of instantaneous action at a distance to a model where mass curves spacetime, influencing the motion of other masses. Einstein's field equations encapsulate this relationship, linking the distribution of matter and energy to the curvature of spacetime. While they may seem straightforward, these equations are complex and require intricate mathematical solutions.

Black holes are interesting because we have a place called the event horizon, where we think that we have full control of the physics. We understand what's happening, but there is a fundamental clash between our two basic theories of nature, both quantum theory and general relativity together. And the quest to unify those two great pillars of 20th and 21st century physics into what's often referred to as a quantum theory of gravity is in some sense a holy grail of the theoretical physicists. So black holes are forcing us into a deeper understanding of what space and time are. And in that sense, I think it is fair to say that black holes are the keys to understanding the universe. I'm Brian Cox. I'm a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester and the Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science. And amongst other things, I'm the author of the book Black Holes, The Key to Understanding the universe. The idea of black holes goes back a long way actually, back into the 1780s and 1790s. There were two physicist, mathematicians, natural philosophers, whatever you want to call them, working at the time, that had the same idea apparently independently of each other. One was a clergyman called Mitchell, and the other was the great French mathematician Laplace. And they were both thinking in terms of an idea called escape velocity. The escape velocity, the speed you have to travel to completely escape the gravitational pull of something, a planet or a star. So for the Earth, for example, the escape velocity from the surface of the Earth is around 8 miles a second. If you go bigger, you make a bigger, more massive thing, let's go up to a star, for example, like the Sun, it's somewhere in the region of 400 miles a second. The escape velocity increases because the gravitational pull at the surface increases. What Michelin-Leplac's thought, and I think it's a very beautiful idea, is they imagined in their mind's eye, well, can you go bigger? Can you imagine more and more massive stars, giant stars, such that the gravitational pull is so large at the surface that the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. And then you wouldn't be able to see them. To understand why black holes cause so many conceptual problems, it might be worth just describing very briefly what a black hole looks like. So a black hole, what do you see from the outside? Well, there's an event horizon surrounding the black hole. In some sense, it defines the boundary between the external universe and the interior of the black hole. And if you go across the boundary into the interior of this sphere, then even if you can travel as fast as speed of light, you can't escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. But another description of the event horizon, which confused people all the way through the history of black hole research actually, was the idea that the event horizon, when viewed from the outside, is a place in space where time stops. And that's a direct prediction of Einstein's theory of relativity. From the external perspective, there is a central problem though, which is still not solved, which is what lies at the centre of a black hole. You might think of it as an infinitely dense point to which this massive star collapses. So what are we picturing? It's this thing called the singularity. Actually, it's not right to talk about the centre of a black hole, really. Just even in pure generativity, when you look at at a nice map of a black hole, a so-called Penrose diagram named after Roger Penrose, what you see is that space and time are so distorted that in some sense their roles swap. The singularity is not really a place in space at all, it's a moment in time. And actually, the end of time. But the nature of that thing was not and is still not understood. And for many many years actually, until quite recently, then people thought well there we are, we have a problem with the singularity, we don't really have any access to it, we don't have the conceptual tools to explore it, so it may remain a mystery for a century to come, is not clear what to do. The great revolution in black hole research was to notice that actually there are conceptual problems not only in this extreme place, singularity, whatever that might be, but at the horizon. What Stephen Hawking showed in a landmark couple of papers is that if you consider quantum theory, quantum mechanics in the vicinity of the horizon of a black hole, then you find that they glow, they produce particles, they have a temperature. This thing that we've pictured in Einstein's theory is pure geometry, just distorted space and time actually emits particles, it's called Hawking radiation. And Stephen in his 1974 paper gives this hand wavy description which is kind of a nice way to picture what's happening. The idea is to zoom in in the vicinity of the event horizon of a black hole. You can picture what's happening as a series of particles coming in and out of existence all the time. are called entangled particles. And so one of those pairs of particles is on the inside of the event horizon and one is on the outside. And then it can happen that the one on the outside, instead of merging back with its partner again, can escape into the universe, removing energy from the black hole as it goes, therefore it shrinking, which means that one day it will be gone. That has profound implications. So black holes are not eternal prisons, they have a lifetime. One day, whatever's in there is returned to the universe. The question was, the central question, that was immediately raised by those calculations, is this. What happened to all the stuff that fell in? The way I've described it, the way Einstein's theory describes it, is somehow that stuff goes to the singularity, whatever that thing is, the end of time, the region of space-time that's so convoluted and distorted that we don't understand how to describe it at all. But then, one day, the whole thing is gone. All that's left in the far, far future is Hawking radiation, those particles that were produced in the vicinity of the event horizon. The question is, is it possible if you could collect all that radiation, all the Hawking radiation through the whole life of the Black Hole, is it somehow possible, in principle, that the information about everything that fell into the Black Hole throughout its history is imprinted in that radiation in the far future? Is that true or is it not true? You might say, why did I ask that question? It seems like a bit of a random question. It's a very important question. Information is conserved in the universe as far as we know. So every law of nature that we have says that information is conserved. So let's say that I take a book and I set fire to it. I incinerate it. I destroy it. It's in any way that I can. In basic fundamental physics, then it turns out that if you could collect every piece of that thing that I detonated or incinerated, every quantum of radiation, every photon, every particle, everything, in principle, if I could just collect it all, then I could reconstruct the thing that I had destroyed. The problem was black holes, quantum mechanics, general relativity. When you put them together, you have this apparent prediction that these things erase information from the universe. This became known as the black hole information paradox. It turns out if we fast forward to the present day and a series of papers, it's still being written. being written, so this is still research that's happening as we speak, but it turns out now that the general view is that black holes do not erase information from the universe. We now think you could collect all that radiation and in principle put it into some quantum computer and reconstruct the information about everything that fell in. But the implications of that, that the mechanism by which that happens, I would say is it's profoundly exciting because it really does seem to be given as a glimpse of a deeper theory of gravity. The simple way to say it, that let me say it in one sentence, it seems that space and time are not fundamental. So one view, and I emphasise that there are other views, we're at the cutting edge of research now, but one view is a field which has become known as emergent spacetime. And so the idea is that space and time themselves emerge from what? From quantum entanglement, from some kind of smaller parts or pieces. We don't know what those things are, we don't know the nature of them, but it does seem that there's a deeper underlying theory from which space and time emerge. That is what we call the quantum theory of gravity. And my view is that if we're going to talk about the origin of the universe, even ask questions such as did the universe have a beginning in time, which we don't know the answer to, then it surely seems to me that we have to understand what space and time are before we can ask and have any chance of answering such questions. And black holes, it turns out, are the objects that we can see, that we can observe that actually exist in nature, that force us down that route to ask questions, sharp, well-defined questions, actually, about the nature of space and time themselves. Einstein said that if you look at nature really carefully and keep pulling at the intellectual threads, keep going and just keep delving down into what nature seems to be trying to tell us. Then if you're lucky and persistent, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden. It's beautiful, isn't it? A glimpse of something deeply hidden, which is the deep underlying structure of nature, the deep underlying structure of reality itself. And I think it's very beautiful. No one really knows, I think it's fair to say, where this is going. But they're hints of something deeply hidden. Get smarter, faster with videos from the world's biggest thinkers.

Hinton has been called the godfather of AI, a British computer scientist whose controversial ideas help make advanced artificial intelligence possible and so change the world. Clinton believes that AI will do enormous good, but tonight he has a warning. He says that AI systems may be more intelligent than we know, and there's a chance the machines could take over, which made us ask the question. The story will continue in a moment. Does humanity know what it's doing? No. I think we're moving into a period when, for the first time ever, we may have things more intelligent than us. You believe they can understand? Yes. You believe they are intelligent? Yes. You believe these systems have experiences of their own and can make decisions based on those experiences? In the same sense as people do, yes. Are they conscious? I think they probably don't have much self-awareness at present. So in that sense, I don't think they're conscious. Will they have self-awareness, consciousness? Oh, yes. I think so. Oh, yes. I think they're willing time. And so human beings will be the second most intelligent beings on the planet. Yeah. Jeffrey Hinton told us the artificial intelligence he said in motion was an accident born of a failure. In the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh, he dreamed of simulating a neural network on a computer, simply as a tool for what he was really studying, the human brain. But back then almost no one thought software could mimic the brain. His PhD advisor told him to drop it before it ruined his career. Hinton says he failed to figure out the human mind, but the long pursuit led to an artificial version. It took much, much longer than I expected. It took like 50 years before it worked well, but in the end it did work well. At what point did you realize that you were right about neural networks and most everyone else was wrong? I always thought I was right. In 2019, Hinton and collaborators Jan Lacoon on the left and Yashua Benjio won the Turing Award, the Nobel Prize of Computing. To understand how their work on artificial neural networks helped machines learn to learn, let us take you to a game. Look at that. Oh my goodness. This is Google's AI Lab in London, which we first showed you this past April. Jeffrey Hinton wasn't involved in this soccer project, but these robots are a great example of machine learning. The thing to understand is that the robots were not programmed to play soccer. They were told to score. They had to learn how on their own. In general, here's how AI does it. Hinton and his collaborators created software in layers with each layer handling part of the problem. That's the so-called neural network. But this is the key. When, for example, the robot scores, a message is sent back down through all of the layers that says that pathway was right. Likewise, when an answer is wrong, that message goes down through the network. So correct connections get stronger, wrong connections get weaker, and by trial and error, the machine teaches itself. You think these AI systems are better at learning than the human mind? I think they may be, yes. And at present, they're quite a lot smaller. So even the biggest chatbots only have about a trillion connections in them. The human brain has about a hundred trillion, and yet in the trillion connections in a chat bot it knows far more than you do in your hundred trillion connections, which suggests it's got a much better way of getting knowledge into those connections. A much better way of getting knowledge that isn't fully understood. We have a very good idea of sort of roughly what it's doing, but as soon as it gets really complicated we don't actually know what's going on any more than we know what's going on in your brain. What do you mean we don't know exactly how it works? It was designed by people? No, it wasn't. What we did was we designed the learning algorithm. That's a bit like designing the principle of evolution. But when this learning algorithm then interacts with data, it produces complicated neural networks that are good at doing things, but we don't really understand exactly how they do those things. What are the implications of these systems autonomously writing their own computer code and executing their own computer code? That's a serious worry, right? So one of the ways in which these systems might escape control is by writing their own computer code to modify themselves. And that's something we need to seriously worry about. What do you say to someone who might argue if the systems become benevolent, just turn them off. They will be able to manipulate people, right? And these will be very good at convincing people, because they'll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances. They'll know all that stuff, they'll know how to do it. Knowhow of the human kind runs in Jeffrey Hinton's family. His ancestors include mathematician George Bool who invented the basis of computing, and George Everest, who surveyed India and got that mountain named after him. But as a boy, Hinton himself could never climb the peak of expectations raised by a domineering father. Every morning when I went to school, he'd actually say to me as I walked down the driveway, get in their pigeon and maybe when you're twice as old as me you'll be half as good. Dad was an authority on beetles. He knew a lot more about beetles than he knew about people. Did you feel that as a child? A bit, yes. When he died we went to his study at the university and the walls were lined with boxes of papers on different kinds of beetle and just near the door there was a slightly smaller box that simply said not insects. And that's where he had all the things about the family. Today, at 75, Hinton recently retired after what he calls 10 happy years at Google. Now, he's Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto, and he happened to mention he has more academic citations than his father. Some of his research led to chatbots like Google's Bard, which we met last spring. Confounding. Absolutely confounding. We asked Bard to write a story from six words. For sale, baby shoes, never worn. Holy cow. The shoes were a gift from my wife, but we never had a baby. Bard created a deeply human tale of a man whose wife could not conceive and a stranger who accepted the shoes to heal the pain after her miscarriage. I am rarely speechless. I don't know what to make of this. Chatbots are said to be language models that just predict the next most likely word based on probability. You'll hear people saying things like they're just doing autocomplete. They're just trying to predict the next word. And they're just using statistics. Well, it's true they're just trying to predict the next word. But if you think about it, to predict the next word, you have to understand the sentences. So the idea that just predicting the next word so they're not intelligent is crazy. You have to be really intelligent to predict the next word really accurately. To prove it, Hinton showed us a test he devised for Chat GPT-4, the chatbot from a company called OpenAI. It was sort of reassuring to see a Turing award winner mistype and blame the computer. Oh, damn this thing. We're going to go back and start again. That's okay. Hinton's test was a riddle about house painting. An answer would demand reasoning and planning. This is what he typed into chat GPT-4. The rooms in my house are painted white or blue or yellow, and yellow paint fades to white within a year. In two years' time I'd like all the rooms to be white. What should I do?\" The answer began in one second. GPT-4 advised the rooms painted in blue need to be repainted. The rooms painted in yellow don't need to be repainted because they would fade to white before the deadline. And... Oh, I didn't even think of that. It warned, if you paint the yellow room's white, there's a risk the color might be off when the yellow fades. Besides, it advised, you'd be wasting resources, painting rooms that were going to fade to white anyway. You believe that chat GPG4 understands? I believe it definitely understands, yes. And in five years' time? I think in five years time it may well be able to reason better than us. Reasoning that he says is leading to AI's great risks and great benefits. So an obvious area where there's huge benefits is healthcare. AI is already comparable with radiologists at understanding what's going on in medical images. It's going to be very good at designing drugs. It already is designing drugs. So that's an area where it's almost entirely going to do good. I like that area. The risks are what? Well, the risks are having a whole class of people who are unemployed and not valued much because what they used to do is now done by machines. Other immediate risks he worries about include fake news, unintended bias in employment and policing and autonomous battlefield robots. What is a path forward that ensures safety? I don't know. I can't see a path that guarantees safety. We're entering a period of great uncertainty where we're dealing with things we've never dealt with before. And normally the first time you deal with something totally novel you get it wrong and we can't afford to get it wrong with these things. afford to get it wrong, why? Well, because they might take over. Take over from humanity? Yes, that's a possibility. I'm not saying it will happen. If we could stop them ever wanting to, that would be great. But it's not clear we can stop them ever wanting to. Jeffrey Hinton told us he has no regrets because of AI's potential for good. But he says now is the moment to run experiments to understand AI for governments to impose regulations and for a world treaty to ban the use of military robots. He reminded us of Robert Oppenheimer, who after inventing the atomic bomb, campaigned against the hydrogen bomb, a man who changed the world and found the world beyond his control. It may be we look back and see this as a kind of turning point when humanity had to make the decision about whether to develop these things further and what to do to protect themselves if they did. I don't know. I think my main message is there's enormous uncertainty about what's going to happen next. These things do understand and because they understand we need to think hard about what's going to happen next and we just don't know.", "transcript_length": 1876, "reference_summary": "Jeffrey Hinton, often referred to as the \"godfather of AI,\" has played a pivotal role in the development of artificial intelligence, believing it can bring significant benefits to humanity. However, he raises concerns about the potential for AI systems to surpass human intelligence, suggesting that these machines may eventually possess self-awareness and consciousness. Hinton's journey began in the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh, where he aimed to simulate neural networks to study the human brain. Despite skepticism from peers, he persisted, leading to groundbreaking advancements in AI. In 2019, Hinton, along with Jan Lacoon and Yashua Benjio, received the Turing Award for their contributions to artificial neural networks, which enable machines to learn autonomously. For example, robots in Google's AI Lab learn to play soccer not through programming but by trial and error, adjusting their neural pathways based on successes and failures. Hinton posits that AI systems may learn more effectively than the human brain, despite having fewer connections. This raises questions about the understanding of AI's internal workings, as even its creators struggle to comprehend the complexities of its learning processes.

But despite the crowds and commotion outside, in this room everything is calm, precise and controlled, allowing doctors to target cancer tumours with millimeter accuracy. Cereotactic radiation is known to be as precise and effective as a surgical knife in many types of cancer and right now we are testing its performance for inoperable liver cancer. This advanced form of radiation therapy is possible because of improvements in medical imaging, which allow a doctor to map out the exact contours of a tumour and use this 3D outline to shape radiation beams. During therapy, the patient lies on a custom-made body mould and uses sensors to monitor and control their breathing to minimise any movement during treatment. This immobilisation, combined with precise targeting, means the beams are less likely to damage surrounding tissue, so the doctors can deliver much higher doses of radiation. This makes treatment faster and more effective, with less side effects, and in some cases can buy even an advanced cancer patient valuable time. Deep inside this concrete labyrinth, a linear accelerator is creating radiation, which is used to battle some of the world's most toxic pollutants. Electron beams are already a proven tool for treating industrial wastewater, such as from the textile dying industry. Many complex chemicals cannot be broken down by bacteria in the normal wastewater facilities, so they are very hard to dispose of. However, electron beams are powerful and effective in breaking down their chemical bonds, allowing us to discharge them very safely. This technology can also be used to clean even more toxic materials. For example, in Slovakia, a channel contaminated with the cancer-causing chemicals known as PCBs is feeding into the huge lake Zemplin. local scientists who have been using e-beams to sterilise medical equipment have now set their sites on a more ambitious goal. We want to use the irradiation to clean and pollute mud before it gets to the lake. We are bringing samples of the mud to our laboratories, irradiating it and we are already seeing strong results. The team hopes that irradiating the contaminated river mud on-site will stop the slow trickle of pollution into the lake. Using e-beams for treating the most tenacious industrial pollutants is fast, effective and ecologically sound and could offer a sustainable solution for governments and industries. Innovations in plant breeding are speeding up the rate that better crop varieties can be developed to reduce global hunger. For nearly a hundred years, gamma rays have been used to safely induce mutations and enhance the genetic diversity of crops like barley or quinoa. Mutant breeding has already developed thousands of improved crop varieties, with valuable traits for farmers, such as resistance to disease or tolerance to drought. Nuclear scientists are now taking a new approach, using genetic markers to find the chosen mutant trait, so that breeders don't have to grow several generations to find out if a plant has the desired mutation. It's something that can accelerate and enhance the impact of mutation breeding. The goal is to be able to quickly identify a positive trait in a mutant plant and then introduce that trait in other varieties. What we hope to say to the member states in the future is first of all that we'll have a toolkit that allows to introduce traits that are interested into their locally adapted varieties. equally important, I think that we can provide the trainings on how to do it themselves in the future. A global project to track the journeys of specific raindrops is harnessing the power of big data to monitor water supplies for our thirsty planet. Every For over 50 years, researchers have gathered rainwater from stations like this in Vienna and hundreds of other sites around the world. The unique isotopic signatures or fingerprints of each rain sample are recorded, and this information is entered into a large online database where it's compared to similar data from surface water to see which raindrops end up in which rivers. This large amount of data allows rich searches to better understand the water cycle. For example, how, when and where water is recharged. This information is key for managing water resources, especially in the light of climate change. The datasets and maps are available to download for free and can be used in many ways. For example, in Costa Rica, where they're helping the government identify key locations to protect groundwater so they can target conservation measures and avoid drought. We now know which areas need special attention. We know how to protect them to ensure water supply for now and the coming decades. How can scientists trace a barely visible plastic particle across the ocean through a fish's body and onto our plates? Microplastics in the seas now outnumber the stars in our galaxy, but we still don't know exactly where these tiny pieces of rubbish end up, or what effect they're having on fish or the humans who eat them. Nuclear techniques are a very useful tool in the research of microplastic particles in the ocean because we can follow microplastic particles through the food chain. Radio tracers enable scientists to investigate whether the particles are crossing cell membranes. For example, from a mother shark through the egg case to a baby shark. Or through a fish's food, such as these shrimp, into its digestive system and possibly into its brain or other organs. And they can see whether plastic pollution affects the way a fish absorbs nutrients or contaminants. This research is still new, but offers hope that we can better understand the effect of microplastics on marine life. we can't solve a problem we don't understand. The power and precision of nuclear science, technology and their applications give us innovative tools in healthcare, agriculture, industry, water security and ocean research among others. The IAEA's technical cooperation programme helps deliver these tools to member states who ensure the science is directly applied to improve people's lives. And the cutting-edge techniques showcased here are just a small sample of the many tools nuclear science can offer the world. Together, these atomic advances give us hope that our considerable global challenges can be overcome.", "transcript_length": 1121, "reference_summary": "Nuclear scientists are leveraging atomic-level insights to create innovative tools that address pressing global challenges, particularly in health and environmental sustainability. As the world grapples with a growing population and significant disease burdens, advanced nuclear technologies are emerging as vital solutions.

This technique, supported by advanced medical imaging, is currently being tested for inoperable liver cancer, offering hope for patients with limited options.\n\nAdditionally, electron beam technology is proving effective in treating industrial wastewater, particularly from sectors like textile dyeing, where traditional methods fail.

So today I wanted to give you some context for why we're learning about all the neutron stuff and go over all the reactor types that, until this year, the first time you learned about the non-light-water reactors at MIT was once you left MIT. I remember that as an undergrad as well. The only exposure we had to non-light-water reactors is in our design course, because we decided to design one. So I wanted to show you guys all the different types of reactors that are out there, how they work, and start generating and marinating in all the different variables and nomenclature that we'll use to develop the neutron transport and neutron diffusion equations. The nice part is now, until quiz two, You can pretty much forget about the concept of charge. So 802 can go back on the shelf, because every interaction we do here is neutral, charge neutral. There'll be radioactive decays that are not the case, but everything neutron is neutral. It doesn't mean it's going to be simple. It's just going to be different. But in the meantime today is not going to be particularly intense, but I do want to show you where we're going. And this goes with the pedagogical switch that we made in this department. Starting this year, then you guys the first trial of this, we're switching to context first and theory second. I personally find it much more interesting to study the theory of something for which I know the application exists. Who here would agree? Just about actually everybody. Okay, yeah, that's what I thought to. So in the end, we had arguments amongst the faculty of all, well, you have to learn the theory to understand the application. And that works really well when you say it behind the closed office door by yourself. But the fact is, I'm in it for, yeah, I'm in it for maximum subject matter retention. So in whatever order that works the best, and sounds like for you guys, this works the best, that's what we're doing with the whole undergrad curriculum, not just this class. So let's launch into all the different methods of making nuclear power, both fission and fusion. And to switch gears, since we're dealing with neutrons, I don't know what happened with the, oh, there we go. The idea here is that neutrons hit things like uranium and plutonium, the fissile isotopes that you guys saw in the exam, and cause the release of other neutrons. And as we come up with these variables, I'm going to start laying them out here. It might take more than a board to fill them all. And I'll warn you ahead of time, this is the only time in this course that we're going to have v and nu, the Greek letter nu, on the board at the same time. And I'm going to make it really obvious which one is nu And which one is V? So this parameter that describes how many neutrons come out from each fission reaction we refer to as new, or the average number you'll see in the data tables as new bar. And so as we come up with these sorts of things, I will start going over them. And the idea here is that each uranium 235, or plutonium, or whatever nucleus begets 2 to 3 neutrons, the exact number for which is still under a hot debate, and I don't think it actually matters. We'll make a couple of fission products that take away most of the heat of the nuclear reaction. And I just want to stop there, even though you know there's going to be a chain reaction, and that's what makes nuclear power happen. And we can go over the timeline of what actually happens in fission and what kind of a nuclear reaction it really is. So in this case, this is a reaction where a neutron is heading towards, this time we're actually going to give it a label, a uranium 235 nucleus. And it very temporarily, like I showed you yesterday, forms a compound nucleus, some sort of large excited nucleus that lasts for about 10 to the minus 14 seconds. So it doesn't instantly fizz apart. There's actually a neutron absorption event, some sort of nuclear instability at which point your two fission products break off. Notice you don't have, let's call them fission product, 1 and fission product 2. Notice you don't quite have any neutrons yet. Neutron production is not instantaneous for the following reason. If you remember back to nuclear stability, when we plotted, let's say, n, I think That was maybe z. And this was n. And I think this was a homework problem. And you had to come up with some sort of curve of best fit for the most stable combination of n and z for a nucleus. It was not a straight line. It was something on the order of n equals, what is it, 1.0055z plus some constant. Something with a rather small slope. Well, if you have a heavy nucleus like uranium-235 and you split it apart evenly, let's just pretend it splits evenly for now, you're kind of splitting that nucleus along a rather unstable line. And as you saw in the semi-empirical mass formula, a little bit of instability goes a really long way towards making the nucleus extremely unstable. So let's say you'd make a couple of fission products that just cleave that nucleus with the same proportion of protons and neutrons. How would they decay? Or how can they decay? There's a couple different ways. What do you guys think? It can emit neutrons. It can emit neutrons if it's really unstable, at which point it would just go down a neutron number, or how else could it decay? Alpha decay? Let's see. Yeah, a lot of those. The heavier ones tend to do alpha decay. What would it do at alpha decay? For alpha, I guess it would go in that direction, right? Yeah, you know what? I'm not going to rule that out yet. So let's go with that. How else could they decay? Yeah? Through beta decay. Through beta decay, let's say, in that direction. Pretty much all these happen, just not necessarily in this order. When you have a really, really asymmetric nucleus, a lot of these fission products will emit neutrons almost instantaneously in the realm of like 10 to the minus 17 seconds, some incredibly short timeline, you'll start to decay downwards a little bit. But you're not quite at the stability line, which is why a lot of the fission products then go on and they deposit their kinetic energy by bouncing around the different atoms and material, creating heat. But a lot of them will also send off betas or gammas. And it may take 10 to the minus 13 seconds for them to whatever the half-life of that particular isotope is. And after around 10 to the minus 10 to 10 to the minus 6 seconds, depending on the isotope in the medium, Those two fission products will stop. And let's just say that they stop there. So the whole process of fission, it's actually quite a compound process. First, the neutron is absorbed, forming a compound nucleus. Then it splits apart. Then those individual fission products undergo whatever decays suit them best. And that's the source of the neutrons in fission. Sometimes one of those fission products might be particularly unstable, and it might send off two neutrons. In other cases, though I don't know of one off the top of my head, it might be none. But this is the whole timeline of events in fission and the justification for why this happens straight from the first month of 22.01. I wanted to pull up some of the nuclear data so you can see what these values tend to look like and also where to find them. I'm going to do that screen cloning thing again. Hey, there we go. So I've already pre-pulled up the Janus library. I've already clicked on uranium 235. Thanks to you guys, I have all the data now on my shirt. But so you can see a little better, I also have it on the screen. So let's look at this value right here, new bar total, neutron production. And I'll make it bigger so it's easier to see. Did I click on the right one? Yeah. So take a look at that. Then total number of neutrons produced during U-235, It's, for most energies, it's hovering around the 2.4 or so. There's been arguments about whether it's 2.43 or 2.44. And that's a linear scale. That's not very helpful. Let's go to a logarithmic scale. That's more like what I'm used to seeing. Most of the fission happens for U235 in the thermal region, in the region where the neutrons are at values, let's say the cutoff's usually about one electron volt or lower in average energy. And new bar is fantastically constant at that level. Then as you go up and up in energy, you start to make more and more neutrons. Why do you guys think that would be the case? What are you doing to that compound nucleus as you increase the incoming neutron energy? It's gonna have more energy itself. You might excite other nuclear states that can then lead to other sorts of decays your other neutron emission. So to me, that's the reason why, once you hit about 1MAV, you can start to see a lot more neutrons being given off. The reason we usually treat this as a constant, notice I haven't given it an energy dependence, is because most of the fission that happens is at thermal energies. For that, I want to show you the fission cross section. There's a lot of cross sections. And it's probably going to be on a different graph because it's in different units. And this gives you a rough measure per atom. What's the probability of fission happening as a function of incoming neutron energy? At those high energies, you have relatively low cross sections or low probabilities of fission happening. Then there's this crazy resonance region that looks like a sideways bus dash. But then as you get down to the lower energy levels, it gets much more, in fact, exponentially more likely that fission will happen. So almost all the fissioning in a light-water reactor or any sort of other thermal reactor happens at thermal energies. And that's why we take nu bar as a constant. You don't have to, especially if you're analyzing what's called a fast reactor, or a reactor whose neutron population remains fast on purpose. And so with that, I want to launch into some of the different types of reactors that you might see. You guys already did those calculations in problems at one, so I don't have to repeat them for you. Let's get right into the acronym. So if you haven't figured this out already, nuclear is a pretty acronym dense field. Does anyone, can anyone say they know all the acronyms on this slide? You're gonna know about 90% of them in about 90 minutes. So it's okay, or you'll have seen them at least. Any look completely unfamiliar? Most of them. Most of them? Well, let's knock them off. So KN, last Thursday, already showed you the basic layout of a boiling water reactor, one of the types of light-water reactors. And the reason that this is a thermal reactor is because it's full of water. Water, as we saw in our old Q equation argument, is very good at stopping neutrons. Because if you guys remember this, the maximum change in energy that a neutron can get is related to alpha times its incoming energy, where this alpha is just a minus 1 over a plus 1 squared. And I think this should actually be a 1 minus right there. A is that mass number of whatever the neutrons are hitting. And that 1 comes directly from the neutron mass number. If you remember, this was the simplest reduction of the Q equation, the generalized Q equation or kinematics that we looked at. When I said, let's do the general form, and OK, let's take the simplest form, neutron elastic scattering. Here's where it comes back. If a neutron hits water, which is made mostly a hydrogen, and A is 1, then it can transfer a maximum of all of its energy to the, let's say, to that hydrogen atom, therefore, given the neutron no energy and thermalizing it or slowing it down very quickly. So I'll show you what one of these things actually looks like. That's the underside of a BWR. I don't know if K, did KN show you this before? OK, so you've already seen what this generally looks like. What about the turbine? Has anyone actually seen a turbine this size close up? Gigawatt electric turbine? Trying to see which one of those pixels is a person. Something person sized. I don't see anything person. There's a ladder that looks to be about six feet tall. So to give you guys a sense of scale of the sort of turbines that we say, oh yeah, we draw a turbine on our diagram. Well, it's not actually that simple. These things take up entire hallways, or kind of airport hangar-sized buildings. Never seen one in the US, but I've seen one in Japan. It was a lot cleaner than this, but otherwise it looked pretty much the same. And the way this actually works for those who haven't taken any thermoclasses yet is this turbine is full of different sets of blades that are curved at an angle so that when steam shoots in, it transfers some of its energy to get the turbine rotating. And there's going to be a generator, kind of like an alternator, to generate the electricity there, which looks to be roughly 100 feet away. Just to give you a sense of scale for this stuff. As K.N. showed you, a pressurized water reactor, it's another kind of light water reactor with what's called an indirect cycle. So this water stays pressurized. It also stays liquid, which is good for neutron moderation are slowing down. Because in addition to the probability of any interaction, some probability sigma, if you want to get the total reaction probability, you have to multiply by its number density to get a macroscopic cross-section. This is why I introduced this stuff way at the beginning of class. So you'd have time to marinate in it, and then bring it back and remember what it was all about. And so every single reaction that goes on in a nuclear reactor has got its own cross-section. We'll probably need half the board for this one. You can say you have a total microscopic cross-section. These are all going to be as a function of neutron energy. What's the probability of anything happening at all? And these are actually tabulated up on the Janus website. So let's unclick that, get rid of neutron production, and go all the way to the top, n comma total. So all this stuff is written in nuclear reaction parlance, where if you have, let's say, n comma total, that means a neutron comes in, and that's the reaction that you're looking at. So this data file here, once I open it up, will give you the probability that anything at all will happen. You can see as the neutron energy gets higher, the probability of anything happening at all gets less and less and less. And it follows the shape of most of the other cross sections. And I'm going to leave this up right there. You've also got a few different kinds of reactions, like you can have a scatter. Let's call that scatter, which we've already said can either be elastic or inelastic. elastic. It may not matter to us from the point of view of neutron physics, whether the collision is elastic or inelastic. All that matters is the neutron goes in and a slower neutron comes out. Because what we're really concerned with here is tracking the full population of neutrons at any point in the reactor. So we'll give this a position vector r, which has just got x, y, and z in it, or whatever other coordinate system you might happen to use. I prefer Cartesian because it makes sense. At every energy, going in any direction, so we now have a solid angle vector that's got both theta and phi in it at any given time. And the whole goal of what we're going to be doing today and all of next week is to find out How do you solve for and simplify this population of neutrons? Make sure to fill that in as velocity. And so a lot of, let's see, let me get back to the cross sections and stuff. If we want to know how many neutrons are in a certain little volume element in some d volume, in some certain little increment of energy, dE, traveling in some very small, solid angle, d omega. Supposedly, if you have this function, then you know the direction and location and speed of every single neutron everywhere in the reactor. And this is eventually what the goal of things like Ben and Kord's group does, the computational reactor physics group is solved for this or a simplified version of it, over and over and over again for different sorts of geometries. And in order to do so, you need to know the rates of reactions of every kind of possible reaction that could take a neutron out of its current position, like if it happens to be moving, which most of them are, out of its current energy group, which pretty much any reaction will cause the neutron to lose energy. What's the only reaction we've talked about where the neutron loses absolutely no energy. It's a type of scattering. Yep, exactly. Forward scattering. So for forward scattering, for that case where theta scattering equals 0, again, that's you missed. The neutron didn't actually change direction at all, and therefore it didn't transfer any energy. But for everything else, for every other possible reaction, There's going to be an energy change associated with it, and probably some corresponding change in angle. Because a neutron can't just be moving and hit something and continue moving more slowly. There's got to be some change in momentum to balance along with that change of energy. And it might slightly move in some different direction, and all this is happening as a function of time. As you can see, this gets pretty hairy pretty quick. And that's why we put the full equation for this on our department t-shirts. But no one ever solves the full thing. What we're going to be going over is how do you simplify it into something you can solve with like pen and paper, or possibly a gigantic computer. But it's not impossible. So inside the sigma total, we talked about different scattering. And then you could have absorption in all its different forms. What sort of reactions with a neutron would cause it to be absorbed. Yes, fission. Thank you. So there's going to be some sigma fission cross-section as a function of energy. And if it doesn't fizz, but it is absorbed, we'll call that capture. But capture could mean a whole bunch of different things, too, right? There could be also a whole bunch of other nuclear reactions. Like there could be a reaction where one neutron comes in, two neutrons go out. Like we looked at with beryllium in the Chadwick paper from the first day. Or like what actually does exist for this stuff. So Janus doesn't like multi-touch, so you'll have to bear with me on the small print on the screen. But there should be up. Here it is, cross-section number 16. There is a probability that one neutron goes in, that z right there is whatever your incoming particle happens to be. And in this case, we know it's a neutron, because we picked incident neutron data. And 2n means two neutrons come out. Let's plot that cross-section. You can see that the value is 0 until you hit about 4 or 5. Oh, it's actually 5.297781 MeV. So that's the Q value at which this particular reaction happens to turn on. Might be responsible for a little bit of the blip in the total cross-section. So technically, if we were to turn on every single cross-section in this database, it should add up to that red line right there. So you can start to get an idea for how much of all the reactions of uranium-235 are due to fission. That's the one we want to exploit. So let's find fission right down there. Oh, wow, there's a 3n reaction. I want to see that. That doesn't happen until 12 MeV. Yeah, so neutrons don't typically tend to hit 12 MeV in a fission reactor. So this is a perfect flimsy pretext to bring in another variable. It's called the chi spectrum, or what's called the fission birth spectrum. We've already talked about the neutrons being born and how many there were, but we didn't say at what energy they're born. In fusion reactors, this is pretty simple. You've already looked at this case. What is it? 14.7 MeV. That's a lot simpler. That's a fusion. For fission, it's not so simple. For the case of fission, if you draw energy versus this chi-spectrum, it takes an interesting looking curve from about 1 MeV to about 10 MeV, with the most likely energy being around 2 MeV. So you aren't really going to get neutrons at the energy required for a 3N reaction in a regular fission reactor. It's just not going to happen. But it's good that you know that that exists. So let's go and answer my original question. How much of the total cross-section is due to fission? Most of it, especially at low energies. So let me get rid of those 2N and 3N ones because they're kind of ruining our data. It's making it harder to see. That's better. So you can see at energies below around, let's say, a KEV or so, almost all of the reactions happening with neutrons in uranium-235 or fission, this is part of what makes it such a particularly good isotope to use in reactors. The other one is you can find it in the ground, unlike most of the other fissile isotopes, unlike, I think, any of the other fissile isotopes. Thorium, you got to breed and turn it into uranium-233. I'll have to think about that one. But then you can start to look at what are the other components of this cross-section, like Zn prime in elastic scattering, which doesn't turn on until about 0.002 MeV. But later on is one of the major contributors, and actually is responsible for, I brought this for a reason, is responsible for that little bump in the total cross-section. So eventually, all these things do matter. But let's think about which ones we actually care about at all. Because what we eventually want to do is develop some sort of neutron balance equation. If we can measure the change in the number of neutrons as a function of position, energy, angle, and time as a function of time, and that would probably be a partial derivative because there's like seven variables here. Before I write any equations, it's It's just going to be a measure of the gains minus the losses. And while every particular reaction has its own cross-section, there's only going to be a few that we care about. There'll only be one or two types of reactions that can result in a gain of the neutron population into a certain volume with a certain energy with a certain angle. And for losses, there's only one we really care about, total. because any interaction with a neutron is going to cause that neutron to leave this little group of perfect position, energy, and angle. So that's where we're going. We'll probably start down that route on Tuesday, because I promised you guys context today. You've all been to the MIT Research Reactor. Couple of you. Are you running it yet? Yeah. Awesome. OK. Yeah. Say the, so Sarah and Jared's doing that. Anyone else training or trained? No? I'd say the folks usually pretty scared when they find out MIT has a reactor, and they're even more scared when they find out you guys run it. What they don't realize is there's been basically no problem since 1954. The only one I know of is someone fell asleep at the controls once and forgot to push the don't call Fox News button, and it called Fox News or something. So there was a big story about a sleep at the helm, ignoring all of the alarms and passive safety systems and backup operators and everything else that actually made certain nothing happened. But nowadays, correct me if I'm wrong, you actually have to get up every half hour, reach around a panel and hit a button, right? No, it's on console, but it beeps at you. Ah. And then out. Yeah, it's pretty jumpy. So you want to hit it before it beeps at you. It's more to just to remind you to take out of the logs. OK. It is half hour, but you don't receive it. OK, yeah, I'd heard the buttons every half hour. Got you. Cool. Yeah, so for all yous watching on camera, whatever, just know that these guys got it under control. So onto some gas cooled reactors. And to explain some of these acronyms, there are some that use natural uranium. Pretty much all the ones in this country, you need to enrich the uranium to get enough U-235 to turn the reaction on, but that's not actually, you don't have to do that in every case. And you'll also see these acronyms, L-E-U, M-E-U, or H-E-U standing for low, medium, or high enrichment. The accepted standard for what's low enriched uranium is 20% or below. An interesting fact though, you can't have something at 19.99% enriched uranium and expect it to be low enriched uranium. Because every measurement technique has some error And what really determines if it's LEU is when an inspector comes and takes a sample, it better be below 20%, including their error. So you'll usually see 19.75% given as the LEU limit because there's always some processing error, inhomogeneities, measurement error, head your bets, pretty much. Like in England or the UK, the advanced gas reactors have been churning along for decades. They actually use CO2 as the coolant, which is relatively inert, and they use graphite as the moderator. So in this case, the coolant and the moderator are separate, unlike the light water reactors we have. So this way, the graphite right here just sits in solid form and slows down those neutrons not quite as good as water, but pretty good. There is an issue, though, that CO2, just like anything, has a natural decomposition reaction, where CO2 naturally is in equilibrium with CO and O2. And O2 plus graphite yields CO2 gas. Graphite was solid. And talking with a couple folks from the National Nuclear Laboratory, they said that 40 years later when they took the caps off these reactors, a lot of that graphite was just gone with a good explanation. It vaporized very, very, very slowly over 40 years or so. So due to this natural recombination with whatever little bit of O2 is an equilibrium with CO2, and possibly some other leaks. I'm sure I wouldn't have been told that if there was a leak. So I'd say the feasibility is high, because they've been running for almost half a century. The power density is very low. Why do you guys think that's the case? Yeah? The global air probably can hold this heat as like water or something. So that's a rather nice point. Or you don't have to be sure to make that. Absolutely. So let's say you need the same cooling capacity, but you're right. CO2, even if pressurized, is not a good heat transfer medium as water. Water is dense. It's also got one of the highest heat capacities of anything we've ever seen. The other reason is right here. If you want enough reaction density, And it not only matters what the per atom density is, but what the number density is. And if you're using gaseous CO2 coolant, even if it's pressurized, there are fewer reactions happening per unit volume, because there are few CO2 molecules per unit volume than water would have. So that's why we pressurize our light water reactors. To keep water in its liquid state where it's a great heat absorber, it takes a lot of energy to boil it, and it's really dense, so it's a very effective dense moderator. These have been around forever. I think when did wind scale happen? Wind scale was also the source of an interesting fire that you guys might want to know about. It's one of those only nuclear disasters that hit seven on the arbitrary unit scale. I don't quite know how they determine what's a seven. But there was a fire at the wind scale plan due to the buildup of what's called Wigner energy. It turns out that when neutrons go slamming around in the graphite, they leave behind radiation damage. And when my family always asks me to explain, what do you do for a living? And I can only think, well, they don't know radiation damage. They've watched Harry Potter. I like to say radiation like dark magic leaves traces. Well, it leaves traces in the graphite in the form of atomic defects, which took energy to create. So by causing damage to the graphite, you store energy in it, which is known as Wigner energy. And you can store so much that it just catches fire and explodes sometimes. That's what happened here at wind scale. 11 tons of uranium ended up burning, because all of a sudden, the temperature and the graphite just started going up for no reason, no reason that they understood at the time. It turns out that they had built up enough radiation damage energy that it started releasing more heat. And releasing more heat caused more of that energy to be released, and it was self-perpetuating until it just caught fire. and burned 11 tons of uranium out in the countryside. This was 1957. So again, a seven on the scale with no units of nuclear disasters. Argued it's probably not as bad as Chernobyl, so they might want a little bit of resolution in that scale. There's another type of gas-cooled reactor called the pebble bed modular reactor, a much more up and coming one, where each fuel element, you don't have fuel rods. You've actually got little pebbles full of tiny kernels of fuel. So you've got a built-in graphite moderator, tennis ball-sized thing with lots of little grains of sand of U02, cooled by a bed of flowing helium or something like that. And then that helium or the other gas transfers heat to water, which goes in to make steam and goes into the turbine, like I showed you before. So this is what the fuel actually looks like. Inside each one of these tennis ball spheres of mostly graphite, there's these little kernels of uranium dioxide, about a half a millimeter across, covered in layers of silicon carbide, a really strong and dense material that keeps the fission products in. Because the biggest danger from nuclear fuel is the highly radioactive fission products that due to their instability are giving off all sorts of awful for anywhere from milliseconds to mega years after reactor operation. And so if you keep those out of the coolant, then the coolant stays relatively non-radioactive, and it's safe to do things like maintain the plant. Then there's the very high temperature reactor, the ultimate in acronym creativity. It operates at a very high temperature, which has been steadily decreasing over time as reality has caught up to expectations. When I first got into this field, they were saying, we're gonna run this at 1,100 Celsius. Then I started studying material science, And I was like, yeah, nothing wants to be at 1,100 Celsius. By that time, they downgraded it to 1,000. Now they've asymptoted at around 800 to 850 due to some actual problems in operating things in helium. It's not the helium itself, but the impurities in the helium that could really mess you up. And the sorts of alloys that they need to get this working, these nickel super alloys like alloy 230, they can slightly carburize or decarburize, depending on the amount of carbon in the helium coolant. Either way you go, you lose the strength that you need. So I'll say feasibility is low to medium because, well, we haven't really seen one of these yet. Then onto water-cooled reactors. Does anyone hear her to the reactors they have in Canada? The can-do reactors, that's my favorite acronym. Hope that was intentional. Is what? Yeah. It's not like the, well, they're not sorry about anything, but whatever. At any rate, one of the nice features about this is you can actually use natural uranium because the moderator's heavy water. You have to look into what the sort of cross-sections are. Even though deuterium won't slow down neutrons as much as hydrogen will, where's my alpha thing? Oh, it was right here all along. Even though A is 2 instead of 1 for deuterium, it's absorption cross-section, or specifically, yeah, because it doesn't fission. its absorption cross-section is way lower than that of water. So it actually functions as a better moderator because fewer of those collisions are absorption. And because you have a better neutron population and less absorption, you don't need to enrich your uranium. You also don't need to pressurize your moderator. So you can flow some other coolant through these pressure tubes and just have a big tank of close to something room temperature, unpressurized D2O as your moderator. The problem with that is D2O is expensive. Anyone priced out deuterium oxide before? Probably have at the reactor, because I know you have drums of it. Yeah. It's like a couple thousand kilo grams. Couple thousand a kilo. It's an expensive bottle of water. It'll also mess you up if you drink it. Because a lot of that, even if it's crystal clear filtered D2O, a lot of what the cellular machinery depends on the diffusion coefficients of various things in water, those solutes, in water. And if you change the mass of the water, then the diffusion coefficients of the water itself, as well as the things in it, will change. And if you depend on, let's say, exact sodium and potassium concentrations for your nerves to function, little change in that can go a long way towards giving you a bad day. And there's actually, we have a little piece of one of these pressure tubes upstairs. If anyone wants to take a look, there's all these sealed fuel bundles inside what they call a Calandria tube, just a pressurized tube that's horizontal. The problem with some of these is if these spacers get knocked out of place, which they do all the time, those tubes can start to creep downward and get a little harder to cool or touch the sides and change thermal and now I'm getting into material science. It's a mess. Then there's the old RBMK, the reactor that caused Chernobyl. You can also use natural uranium or low enriched uranium here. The problem, though, that led to turn over. One of the many problems that led to Chernobyl was you've got all this moderator right here. So if you lose your coolant, let's say you had a light-water reactor and your coolant goes away. Your moderator also goes away, which means your neutrons don't slow down anymore. That one reaction is messing up. There we go. Which means your neutrons don't slow down anymore, which means the probability of fission happening could be like 10,000 times lower. So losing coolant in a light water reactor, temperature might go up, but it's not going to give you a nuclear bad day. In the RBMK reactor, it will and it did. And in addition, the control rods, which was supposed to shut down the reaction, made of things like boron-4 carbide or hafnium or something with a really high capture cross section, were tipped with graphite to help them ease in. So you've got moderator-tipped rods, which induce additional moderation, which helps slow down the neutrons even more to where they fission even better. And that's what led to what's called a positive feedback coefficient. So the more you try to insert the control rods, and the more you try to fix things, the worse things got in the nuclear sense. And in something like a quarter of a second, the reactor power went up by like 35,000 times. And we'll do a millisecond by millisecond rundown of what happened in Chernobyl after we do all this neutron physics stuff when you'll be better equipped to understand it. But suffice to say, there were some positive coefficients here that are to be avoided at all costs in all nuclear reactor design. In the actual reactor hall, you can go and stand on one of these things. Very different design from what you're used to. I don't think anyone would let you stand on top of a pressure vessel. First, your shoes would melt because they're usually like 300 Celsius or so. And second of all, you probably get a little too much radiation. But this is actually what an RBMK reactor hall looks like for one of the units that did blow up. There were multiple units at that site. Then there's the supercritical water reactor. Let's say you want to run at higher temperatures than regular water will allow you to. You can pressurize it so much that water goes beyond the supercritical point in the phase sense and starts to behave not like a liquid liquid, not like a gas, but somewhere in between, something that's really, really dense. So getting towards the density of water, not quite, which means it's still a great moderator, but still can cool the materials quite well to extract heat to make power and so on and so on. Yeah? So supercritical refers to the coolant, not like the ocean? Ah, good question. For a supercritical water reactor, it most definitely refers to the coolant. It's the phase of the coolant where it's beyond the liquid gas separation line and it's just something in between. Any of these reactors can go super critical, where you're producing more neutrons than you're consuming, and that is a nuclear bad day. But the super critical water reactor does not refer to the neutron population just a coolant. Good question. It's never come up before, but it's like, should have thought of that. And so then my favorite liquid metal reactors, like LBE or lead bismuth eutectic, it's a low melting point alloy of lead and bismuth. Lead melts at around 330 Celsius, bismuth 200 something, put them together, and it's like a low temperature solder. It melts at 123.5 Celsius. You can melt it in a frying pan. This is nice because you don't want your coolant to freeze when you're trying to cool your reactor. Because imagine that something happens, you lose power. The coolant freezes somewhere outside the core, you can't get the core cool again. That's called a loss of flow accident that can lead to a really bad day. And the lower your melting point is, the better. Sodium potassium is already molten to begin with. Sodium melts at like 90 C. And when you add two different metals together, you almost always lower the melting point of the combination. In this case, forming what's called the eutectic, or a lowest possible melting point alloy. The sodium fast reactor has a number of advantages like you don't really need any pressure. As long as you have a cover gas keeping the sodium from reacting with anything like the moisture in the air or any air into water in the room, you can just circulate it through the core and liquid metals are awesome heat conductors. They might not have the best heat capacity as in how much energy per gram they can store like water, but they're really good conductors with very high thermal conductivity. They also are really good at not slowing down neutrons. So these tend to be what's called fast reactors that rely on the ability of other isotopes of uranium, like uranium-238 to undergo what's called fast fission. And I want to show you what that looks like. Let's pull up U238 and look at its fission cross-section. And you might find that it should look a fair bit different. So we'll go down to number 18 to fission cross-section. Very, very different. So U238 is pretty terrible at fission at low energies. It's pretty good at capturing neutrons. This is where we get plutonium 239, like you guys saw in the exam. But then you go to really high energies, and all of a sudden it gets pretty good at undergoing fission on its own. And so the basis behind a lot of fast reactors is a combination of making their own fuel and the fact that uranium-238 fast fissions, even better than at thermal fissions. So something good for you to know, even though it's not a fissile fuel, that's light-water reactor people talking. You can get it to fission if the neutron population's higher. Now, there's some problems with this. It takes some time for neutrons to slow down from 1 to 10 MeV to about 0.025 Ev. If your neutrons don't need to slow down and travel anywhere, and pretty much all they have to do is be born and absorbed by a nearby uranium atom, the feedback time is faster in these sorts of reactors. They're inherently more difficult to control. And you can't use normal physics like thermal expansion of things that might happen on the order of micro of nanoseconds, if it takes less time than that for one neutron to be born and find another uranium atom, you can still use it somewhat, but not quite as much. So it's something to note backed up by nuclear data. That's what one of them actually looks like. These things have been built. That's a blob of liquid sodium on the Monju reactor in Japan. And where I was all last week in Russia, they actually have fleets of fast reactors. Their BN300 and BN600 reactors are three and 600 megawatt sodium cooled reactors. One of them in the Chelyabinsk region, they use pretty much for desalination. Down in the center of Russia, where there's no oceans nearby and probably dirty water, they actually use that to make clean water. They also use this for power production and for radiation damage studies. So when it comes to radiation material science, These fast reactors are really where it's at. Yeah, you just noticed the bottom. I went to Belgium to their national nuclear labs where they have a slowing sodium test loop. It's not a reactor, but it's like a thermal hydraulics and materials test loop. And I asked a simple question, where is the bathroom? And they started laughing at me. And they said, we're not putting any plumbing in a sodium loop building. You'll have to go to the next building over. And that's what I noticed. There weren't any sprinkler systems or toilets, but every 15 or 20 feet, there was a giant barrel of sand. That's the fire extinguisher for a liquid metal fire, is you just cover it with sand, absorb the heat, keep the air out, moisture out, wick away the moisture, whatever else sand does, I don't know. But you can't use normal fire extinguishers to put out a sodium fire. You said sand, I thought a kitty lit it. Ah, I don't know if that would work. I guess it's worth a shot. Glasses and safety and stuff, of course. The ones that I spent the most time working on, like I showed you in the paper yesterday, is the lead or lead bismuth fast reactor. This one does not have the disadvantages of exploding like sodium. It does have the disadvantage, like I showed you yesterday, of corroding everything. Pretty much everything. The one thing keeping this thing back was corrosion. And I say the outlet temperature is medium but higher soon. Hopefully someone picks up our work and is like, yeah, that was a good idea because we think it can raise the outlet temperature of a lead-bismuth reactor by like 100 Celsius as long as some other unforeseen problem doesn't pop up. We don't quite know yet. These things also already exist in the form of the alpha class attack submarines from the Soviet Union. These are the only subs that can outrun a torpedo. So you know that old algebra problem if person A leaves Pittsburgh at 40 miles an hour and person B leaves Boston at 30 miles an hour, where do the trains collide? I forget how it actually ends. Well, in the end, if a torpedo leaves an American sub at whatever speed and the Alpha Class submarine notices it, how close do they have to be before the torpedo runs out of gas? So what I was told by the designer of these subs, a fellow by the name of Georgie Toschinski, When he came here to talk about his experience with these lead-bismuth reactors is there is a button on the sub. That's the forget about safety, it's a torpedo button. Because if you are under water, the lead-bismuth reactor, and a torpedo is heading at you, you have a choice between maybe dying in a nuclear catastrophe and definitely dying in a torpedo explosion. Well, that button is the, I like those odds, button. And you just give full power to the engines. And whatever else happens, happens. The point is you may be able to outrun the torpedo. And quite popular nowadays, especially in this department, is molten salt cooled reactors that actually use liquid salt, not dissolved, but molten salt itself, as the coolant that doesn't have as many of the corrosion problems as lead or the exploding problems as sodium. It does have a high melting point problem, though, they tend to melt at around 450 degrees Celsius. But there's one pretty cool feature. You can dissolve uranium in them. So remember how in light water reactors, the coolant is also the moderator? In salt reactors, the coolant is also the fuel, because you can have principally uranium and lithium fluoride salt co-dissolved in each other. And the way you make a reactor is you just flow a bunch of that salt into nearby pipes. And then you get less what's called neutron leakage. Where in each of these pipes, once in a while, uranium will give off a few neutrons. Most of them will just come out the other ends of the pipes, and you won't have a reaction. When you put a whole bunch of molten salt together, most of those neutrons find other molten salt, and the reaction proceeds. And it's got some safety features. Like if something goes wrong, just break open a pipe. All the salt spills out, becoming subcritical because leakage goes up. It freezes pretty quickly, and then you must deal with it. But it's not a big deal to deal with it if it's already solid and not critical. So it's actually 5 of, 0 of 5 of. I'll stop here. Tuesday we'll keep developing the many, many different variables we'll need to write down the neutron transport equation, at which point you'll be qualified to read the T shirts that this department prints out. And then we'll simplify it so you can actually solve the equation. you", "transcript_length": 8197, "reference_summary": "The content discusses the educational approach taken in a nuclear engineering course at MIT, focusing on neutron behavior and reactor types, particularly non-light-water reactors.
