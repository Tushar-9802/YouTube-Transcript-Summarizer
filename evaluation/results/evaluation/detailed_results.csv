This process starts in your digestive system. Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet for a sore ankle. Within minutes the tablet starts disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach. The dissolved ibuprofen travels into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall into a network of blood vessels. These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood and anything in it to the liver. The next step is to make it through the liver.

Though they consist of only a single cell, their total biomass is greater than that of all plants and animals combined. And they live virtually everywhere, on the ground, in the water, on your kitchen table, on your skin, even inside you. Don't reach for the panic button just yet. Although you have 10 times more bacterial cells inside you than your body has human cells, many of these bacteria are harmless or even beneficial, helping digestion and immunity. But there are a few bad apples that can cause harmful infections, from minor inconveniences to deadly epidemics. Fortunately, there are amazing medicines designed to fight bacterial infections. Synthesized from chemicals or occurring naturally in things like mold, these antibiotics kill or neutralize bacteria by interrupting cell wall synthesis or interfering with vital processes like protein synthesis, all while leaving human cells unharmed.

This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist investigating the properties of infectious bacteria. At At this time, Fleming is away on vacation. When he returns, he finds a colony of mold growing on a petri dish he'd forgotten to place in his incubator. And around this colony of mold is a zone completely and unexpectedly clear of bacteria. In studying this mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold was secreting some kind of compound that was killing the bacteria. The mold was a species in the penicillium genus, so Fleming dubbed the antibacterial compound penicillin. What Fleming stumbled upon was a microbial defense system. The penicillium mold constantly produces penicillin in order to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies that might consume its resources. Penicillin destroys many types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis of their cell walls.

Force is defined as mass times acceleration. Mass is the amount of matter in an object and a measure of its inertia. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

Newton also discovered that every mass attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This is known as the law of universal gravitation. The bigger the masses and the closer they are to each other, the stronger the gravitational force.

This is due to the fact that light emitted from the object gets redshifted and eventually fades. From a distant perspective, it may seem that all objects that have fallen into the black hole are frozen on its horizon. However, in practice, photons are emitted at discrete intervals, and the images of objects fading away will eventually disappear.

First, let us consider the limits of mathematical understanding. One of the most famous results in mathematics is Gödel's incompleteness theorem. This theorem states that any sufficiently complex mathematical system contains statements that cannot be proven or disproven within that system. This means that there are statements that are true but cannot be proven to be true within the system.

Gödel's incompleteness theorem is a result of mathematical logic, which is the study of the foundations of mathematics. In particular, it is a result of the study of formal systems, which are systems of symbols and rules for manipulating those symbols.

We start with the assumptions of classical physics, assuming that the particle is a point mass that moves with constant velocity. We then simulate the motion of the particle and show that it maintains a constant velocity. We then describe the initial setup for the quantum simulation, which involves representing the particle by a wave function. We explain how to read information about the particle's position from the wave function and show that the wave function evolves with time according to the Schrödinger equation. We then simulate the evolution of the wave function and show that it glides to the right. We conclude by summarizing the differences between the predictions of classical and quantum physics for the particle's motion. In classical physics, the particle moves with constant velocity, while in quantum physics, the particle is represented by a wave function that evolves with time. The wave function contains information about the probability distribution of the particle's position, but it does not give us exact information about the particle's position or velocity.",0.5958549222797926,0.27083333333333337,0.3160621761658031,0.8477981090545654
zNVQfWC_evg,scientific,lora,"In this talk, I'd like to tell you about one of the big questions in science. It's a question that goes back at least two and a half thousand years to the ancient Greeks, and it's a question that has been discussed in this room many, many times over the past 200 years, but it's an important question and I think it's important that we revisited. And the question is simply this, what are we made of? What are the fundamental building blocks of nature that you and me and everything else in the universe are constructed from?

So what I'd like to do is try and give you an overview of our current understanding. I'd also like to try and give you an overview of where we hope to go in the future, of what progress we can hope to make in the next few years and few decades. And we're going to cover quite a lot of ground in this talk. I should warn you now, not least because I'm going to discuss every single thing in the universe, quite literally. We'll also talk about experiments in the last few years that look backwards in time towards the Big Bang that give us some understanding about what was happening in",0.406392694063927,0.1055045871559633,0.1963470319634703,0.8477981090545654

From opening it, he has startled to find himself facing the imposing figure of Urbain Le Verrier, France's most famous astronomer and the director of the Imperial Observatory in Paris. Now, without so much as a how-do-you-do, Urbain Le Verrier forces his way into Les Garbots hallway demanding to inspect his astronomical equipment. You see, Les Garbots, as well as tending to the aches and pains of his local community, is a keen amateur astronomer, and a week or so earlier, he wrote a letter to Le Verrier telling him about a strange object that he saw crossing the face of the sun earlier that year. Now, this letter so incensed Le Verrier that despite it being New Year's Eve, he immediately jumped on a train and just a few hours later was hammering on poor old Lescarbo's front door.

We will also discuss the fact that light exhibits both wave and particle properties and that it can be described by both a wave function and a probability density function. We will then discuss the fact that light is a form of energy and that it can be described by a frequency and a wavelength.

XRr1kaXKBsU,scientific,lora,"In this video, the speaker explains that according to the general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force. Instead, gravity is an illusion. The speaker uses the example of a man falling off a roof to illustrate this point. The man is not in a gravitational field and is not accelerating. He is an inertial observer. The speaker then explains that the man falling off the roof is equivalent to a person in deep space in a spaceship. Both observers are weightless and inertial. The speaker concludes by saying that there is no experiment that can distinguish between these two observers. Therefore, there are no gravitational fields. The speaker then asks the viewer to imagine what it would be like to be in deep space, weightless and inertial, and to consider the implications of this for our understanding of gravity.",0.5123966942148761,0.16620498614958448,0.2699724517906336,0.8477981090545654

pGsbEd6w7PI,scientific,lora,"Black holes are fascinating objects that have puzzled scientists for centuries. They are regions of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Despite their mysterious nature, black holes are a crucial part of our understanding of the universe. In this article, we will explore the history of black holes, their properties, and the theories that attempt to explain them.

The idea of black holes can be traced back to the 18th century, when two scientists, John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace, independently proposed the existence of such objects. Michell, a British clergyman, suggested that if a star were to collapse in on itself, it would create a region of space from which nothing could escape. Laplace, a French mathematician, came to a similar conclusion based on the escape velocity of a star.

The modern understanding of black holes began in the 1960s, when physicists realized that the solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity could describe regions of space where the gravitational pull was so strong that nothing, not even light, could escape. These regions are now known as black holes.

Black holes are characterized by their mass",0.5126903553299492,0.1683673469387755,0.23857868020304568,0.8477981090545654
qrvK_KuIeJk,scientific,lora,"Jeffrey Hinton is a British computer scientist who is considered the godfather of artificial intelligence. He is known for his controversial ideas that help make advanced artificial intelligence possible and change the world. Hinton has been working on artificial intelligence since the 1970s, when he dreamed of simulating a neural network on a computer as a tool for studying the human brain. However, at the time, almost no one thought software could mimic the brain. His PhD advisor told him to drop it before it ruined his career. Hinton says he failed to figure out the human mind, but the long pursuit led to an artificial version. It took much longer than he expected. Hinton's work on artificial intelligence has been controversial because he believes that AI systems may be more intelligent than we know, and there's a chance the machines could take over. He says that AI systems may be more intelligent than we know, and there's a chance the machines could take over. However, he also believes that AI will do enormous good.
